<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>This first collected edition of my poems contains
all the verses I care to retain except the
translations from the German, published in 1895
under the title of <em>The White Snake</em>, and some
of the poems in <em>Nature-Notes and Impressions</em>,
published in 1906.</p>

<p>Several of the poems which I probably would
have omitted I have retained at the solicitation
of friends, who have based their argument for
their retention upon the generally admitted fact
that a poet seldom knows his best work.</p>

<p>The new arrangement under new titles I found
was necessary for the sake of convenience; and
the poems in a manner grouped themselves in
certain classes. In eliminating the old titles&mdash;some
eighteen in number&mdash;I have disregarded
entirely, except in the case of the first volume,
the date of the appearance of each poem, placing
every one, according to its subject matter, in its
proper group under its corresponding title.</p>

<p>Most of the poems, especially the earlier ones,
have been revised; many of them almost entirely
rewritten and, I think, improved.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>Since the disappearance of the latest survivors
of that graceful and somewhat academic school
of poets who ruled American literature so long
from the shores of Massachusetts, serious poetry
in the United States seems to have been passing
through a crisis of languor. Perhaps there is
no country on the civilized globe where, in theory,
verse is treated with more respect and, in
practice, with greater lack of grave consideration
than in America. No conjecture as to the reason
of this must be attempted here, further than
to suggest that the extreme value set upon sharpness,
ingenuity and rapid mobility is obviously
calculated to depreciate and to condemn the quiet
practice of the most meditative of the arts.
Hence we find that it is what is called "humorous"
verse which is mainly in fashion on the
western side of the Atlantic. Those rhymes are
most warmly welcomed which play the most preposterous
tricks with language, which dazzle by
the most mountebank swiftness of turn, and
which depend most for their effect upon paradox
and the negation of sober thought. It is probable
that the diseased craving for what is "smart,"
"snappy," and wide-awake, and the impulse to see
everything foreshortened and topsy-turvy, must
wear themselves out before cooler and more
graceful tastes again prevail in imaginative literature.</p>

<p>Whatever be the cause, it is certain that this
is not a moment when serious poetry, of any
species, is flourishing in the United States. The
absence of anything like a common impulse
among young writers, of any definite and intelligible,
if excessive, <em>parti pris</em>, is immediately
observable if we contrast the American, for instance,
with the French poets of the last fifteen
years. Where there is no school and no clear
trend of executive ambition, the solitary artist,
whose talent forces itself up into the light and
air, suffers unusual difficulties, and runs a constant
danger of being choked in the aimless mediocrity
that surrounds him. We occasionally
meet with a poet in the history of literature, of
whom we are inclined to say: "Charming as he
is, he would have developed his talent more evenly
and conspicuously, if he had been accompanied
from the first by other young men like-minded,
who would have formed for him an atmosphere
and cleared for him a space." This is the one
regret I feel in contemplating, as I have done
for years past, the ardent and beautiful talent of
Mr. Madison Cawein. I deplore the fact that
he seems to stand alone in his generation; I think
his poetry would have been even better than it
is, and its qualities would certainly have been
more clearly perceived, and more intelligently
appreciated, if he were less isolated. In his own
country, at this particular moment, in this matter
of serious nature-painting in lyric verse, Mr.
Cawein possesses what Cowley would have
called "a monopoly of wit." In one of his
lyrics Mr. Cawein asks&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"The song-birds, are they flown away,</div>
  <div class="i1">The song-birds of the summer-time,</div>
  <div class="i0">That sang their souls into the day,</div>
  <div class="i1">And set the laughing hours to rhyme?</div>
  <div class="i0">No cat-bird scatters through the hush</div>
  <div class="i1">The sparkling crystals of her song;</div>
  <div class="i0">Within the woods no hermit-thrush</div>
  <div class="i1">Trails an enchanted flute along."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>To this inquiry, the answer is: the only hermit-thrush
now audible seems to sing from Louisville,
Kentucky. America will, we may be perfectly
sure, calm herself into harmony again, and possess
once more her school of singers. In those
coming days, history may perceive in Mr. Cawein
the golden link that bound the music of the past
to the music of the future through an interval of
comparative tunelessness.</p>

<p>The career of Mr. Madison Cawein is represented
to me as being most uneventful. He
seems to have enjoyed unusual advantages for
the cultivation and protection of the poetical temperament.
He was born on the 23rd of March,
1865, in the metropolis of Kentucky, the vigorous
city of Louisville, on the southern side of the
Ohio, in the midst of a country celebrated for
tobacco and whisky and Indian corn. These are
commodities which may be consumed in excess,
but in moderation they make glad the heart of
man. They represent a certain glow of the
earth, they indicate the action of a serene and
gentle climate upon a rich soil. It was in this
delicate and voluptuous state of Kentucky that
Mr. Cawein was born, that he was educated, that
he became a poet, and that he has lived ever
since. His blood is full of the color and odor
of his native landscape. The solemn books of
history tell us that Kentucky was discovered in
1769, by Daniel Boone, a hunter. But he first
discovers a country who sees it first, and teaches
the world to see it; no doubt some day the city
of Louisville will erect, in one of its principal
squares, a statue to "Madison Cawein, who discovered
the Beauty of Kentucky." The genius
of this poet is like one of those deep rivers of
his native state, which cut paths through the
forests of chestnut and hemlock as they hurry
towards the south and west, brushing with the
impulsive fringe of their currents the rhododendrons
and calmias and azaleas that bend from
the banks to be mirrored in their flashing waters.</p>

<p>Mr. Cawein's vocation to poetry was irresistible.
I do not know that he even tried to resist
it. I have even the idea that a little more resistance
would have been salutary for a talent
which nothing could have discouraged, and
which opposition might have taught the arts of
compression and selection. Mr. Cawein suffered
at first, I think, from lack of criticism more than
from lack of eulogy. From his early writings I
seem to gather an impression of a Louisville
more ready to praise what was second-rate than
what was first-rate, and practically, indeed, without
any scale of appreciation whatever. This
may be a mistake of mine; at all events, Mr.
Cawein has had more to gain from the passage of
years in self-criticism than in inspiring enthusiasm.
The fount was in him from the first; but
it bubbled forth before he had digged a definite
channel for it. Sometimes, to this very day, he
sports with the principles of syntax, as Nature
played games so long ago with the fantastic
caverns of the valley of the Green River or with
the coral-reefs of his own Ohio. He has bad
rhymes, amazing in so delicate an ear; he has
awkwardness of phrase not expected in one so
plunged in contemplation of the eternal harmony
of Nature. But these grow fewer and less obtrusive
as the years pass by.</p>

<p>The virgin timber-forests of Kentucky, the
woods of honey-locust and buckeye, of white
oak and yellow poplar, with their clearings full
of flowers unknown to us by sight or name, from
which in the distance are visible the domes of the
far-away Cumberland Mountains,&mdash;this seems
to be the hunting-field of Mr. Cawein's imagination.
Here all, it must be confessed, has hitherto
been unfamiliar to the Muses. If Persephone
"of our Cumnor cowslips never heard,"
how much less can her attention have been arrested
by clusters of orchids from the Ocklawaha,
or by the song of the whippoorwill, rung out
when "the west was hot geranium-red" under
the boughs of a black-jack on the slopes of
Mount Kinnex. "Not here," one is inclined to
exclaim, "not here, O Apollo, are haunts meet
for thee," but the art of the poet is displayed by
his skill in breaking down these prejudices of
time and place. Mr. Cawein reconciles us to his
strange landscape&mdash;the strangeness of which
one has to admit is mainly one of nomenclature,&mdash;by
the exercise of a delightful instinctive pantheism.
He brings the ancient gods to Kentucky,
and it is marvelous how quickly they learn to be
at home there. Here is Bacchus, with a spicy
fragment of calamus-root in his hand, trampling
the blue-eyed grass, and skipping, with the air
of a hunter born, into the hickory thicket, to
escape Artemis, whose robes, as she passes swiftly
with her dogs through the woods, startle the
humming-birds, silence the green tree-frogs, and
fill the hot still air with the perfumes of peppermint
and pennyroyal. It is a queer landscape,
but one of new natural beauties frankly and sympathetically
discovered, and it forms a <em>mise en
scene</em> which, I make bold to say, would have
scandalized neither Keats nor Spenser.</p>

<p>It was Mr. Howells,&mdash;ever as generous in discovering
new talent as he is unflinching in reproof
of the effeteness of European taste,&mdash;who
first drew attention to the originality and beauty
of Mr. Cawein's poetry. The Kentucky poet
had, at that time, published but one tentative
volume, the <em>Blooms of the Berry</em>, of 1887. This
was followed, in 1888, by <em>The Triumph of Music</em>,
and since then hardly a year has passed without
a slender sheaf of verse from Mr. Cawein's
garden. Among these (if a single volume is to
be indicated), the quality which distinguishes
him from all other poets,&mdash;the Kentucky flavor,
if we may call it so,&mdash;is perhaps to be most
agreeably detected in <em>Intimations of the Beautiful</em>.</p>

<p>But it is time that I should leave the American
lyrist to make his own appeal, with but one additional
word of explanation, namely, that in this
introduction Mr. Cawein's narrative poems on
medieval themes, and in general his cosmopolitan
writings, have been neglected of mention in
favor of such nature lyrics as would present
him most vividly in his own native landscape, no
visitor in spirit to Europe, but at home in that
bright and exuberant West&mdash;</p>

 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Now, to his castle, Math, through Gwydion,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">The son of Don,&mdash;the daughter dark of Don,</div>

  <div class="i0">A southern rose of beauty, whom Math thought</div>
  <div class="i0">To wed, in love and friendship, without blame,</div>

  <div class="i0">"Forsooth, another Mary!" then in wrath</div>
  <div class="i0">Laid harsh hands on the babe and fiercely flung</div>
  <div class="i0">Far in the salt sea. But the strong winds clung</div>
  <div class="i0">Fast to the Elfin and the lithe waves swept</div>
  <div class="i0">Him safely shoreward dry; some fishers kept</div>
  <div class="i0">Him thus unseaed and christened Dylan, fair</div>
  <div class="i0">Son of the wave, and fostered him with care.</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor was this really hers. But Gwydion,</div>
  <div class="i0">Brother to Arianrod, before the sun</div>
  <div class="i0">Had time to glimpse it with one golden glaive,</div>
  <div class="i0">Swiftly,&mdash;as hoping the real babe to save,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Some dim small body on the castle pave</div>
  <div class="i0">In raven velvet seized; and, hiding, he</div>
  <div class="i0">Stole this from court, to subtly raise to be</div>
  <div class="i0">A comely youth. In time, to Arianrod</div>
  <div class="i0">Came, swearing by the rood and blood of God</div>
  <div class="i0">He brought her back her son.</div>

  <div class="i0">Dost damn thyself with, thus to mix our name</div>
  <div class="i0">With this dishonor, brother, than myself!"</div>
  <div class="i0">Then, waxing wroth, cried Gwydion, "The Elf</div>
  <div class="i0">Is thine then?&mdash;Tell me, wanton! is thy son</div>
  <div class="i0">Dylan, the fisher, or this fair-haired one,</div>

  <div class="i0">And now I tell thee, keep from out my path!</div>
  <div class="i0">Thou and thy bastard, he as well as thou!</div>
  <div class="i0">Thou dog! And on thy folly, listen, now</div>
  <div class="i0">I lay a threefold curse: behold! the first&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Until I name him, nameless be he! Cursed</div>
  <div class="i0">Be they who give him arms!&mdash;the second:&mdash;nor</div>
  <div class="i0">Shall he bear arms until I arm for war.</div>
  <div class="i0">And, lastly, know, however high his birth,</div>
  <div class="i0">He shall not wed a woman of the Earth!&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Malignity! to shame me with thy sin!"</div>
  <div class="i0">Then passed into her tower and locked her in.</div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">But Gwydion, departing with the youth,</div>
  <div class="i0">Sware he would compass her; if not through truth,</div>
  <div class="i0">Through wiles and learnéd magic. And he wrought</div>
  <div class="i0">So that unbending Arianrod was brought</div>
  <div class="i0">To name the lad. Again he managed that,</div>
  <div class="i0">Though strange enchantments as of war, he gat</div>
  <div class="i0">Her to give arms. But then, not for his life,</div>
  <div class="i0">Howbeit, could he get the youth a wife.</div>
  <div class="i0">Persisting, desperate, at last the thing</div>
  <div class="i0">Wrought in him blusterous as a backward spring.</div>
  <div class="i0">Now Llew the youth was named. And Gwydion</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>

  <div class="i0">Complete in beauty. One far lovelier</div>
  <div class="i0">Than Branwen, daughter of the gray King Llyr;</div>
  <div class="i0">Or that dark daughter of Leodegrance,</div>
  <div class="i0">The stately Gwenhwyvar. And young romance</div>
  <div class="i0">Dreamed in the open Bibles of her eyes:</div>
  <div class="i0">Music her motion; and her speech, like sighs</div>
  <div class="i0">Of roses swinging in the wind and rain,</div>
  <div class="i0">And lilies dancing on the sunlit plain:</div>
  <div class="i0">And in her eyes and face there bloomed again</div>
  <div class="i0">The bluebell and the poppy; and fern and bud</div>
  <div class="i0">Gave grace and glory to her maidenhood:</div>
  <div class="i0">And all the attributes of all the flowers</div>
  <div class="i0">Were in her body, that was not like ours</div>
  <div class="i0">And yet was like: but in her brow and face</div>
  <div class="i0">Was love alone and beauty, and no trace,</div>
  <div class="i0">No least suggestion of an earthly pain,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or hate, or sorrow, or of worldly stain;</div>

<blockquote>

<p>Note.&mdash;In this poem, which originally appeared in a
volume of mine entitled <em>Lyrics and Idylls</em>, published in
1890, some hypercritical critic in the New York <em>Nation</em>
accused me of imitating Browning's <em>The Laboratory</em>.
The truth of the matter is that the poem was written
ten months before I had ever read Browning's <em>Dramatic
Lyrics</em>, and was suggested to me by the reading
of the following passage in one of E. T. W. Hoffman's
(the German Poe's) stories. The passage occurs in
<em>Mademoiselle De Scuderi</em> and is as follows: "The
poisons which Sainte Croix prepared were of so subtle
a nature that if the powder (called by the Parisians
<em>Poudre de Succession</em>, or Succession Powder) were
prepared with the face exposed, a single inhalation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
it might cause instantaneous death. Sainte Croix
therefore, when engaged in its manufacture, always
wore a mask of fine glass. One day, just as he was
pouring a prepared powder into a phial, his mask fell

  <div class="i0">The spirits of the foam came whispering;</div>
  <div class="i0">And from gray Neptune's coral-columned caves</div>
  <div class="i0">The wet Oceänids rose through the waves;</div>
  <div class="i0">With naked limbs we saw them breast the spray,</div>
  <div class="i0">Their pearl-white bodies tempesting the way;</div>
  <div class="i0">Their sea-green hair, tossed streaming to the breeze,</div>
  <div class="i0">Scattering with brightness all the tumbled seas.</div>
  <div class="i0">'Mid columned aisles, seen vaguely through the trees,</div>
  <div class="i0">We watched the Satyrs chase the Dryades;</div>
  <div class="i0">Heard Pan's shrill trebles and the Triton's horn</div>
  <div class="i0">Sound from the flying foam when ruddy Morn,</div>
  <div class="i0">With dewy eyelids, opened azure eyes,</div>
  <div class="i0">And, blushing, rose, and left her couch of skies.</div>
  <div class="i0">We saw the Naiad, clothed with veiling mist,</div>
  <div class="i0">Half hidden in a bay of amethyst,</div>
  <div class="i0">With shell-like breasts, and at her hollow ear</div>
  <div class="i0">A shell's pink labyrinth held up to hear</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Circean echoes of the Siren's strains</div>
  <div class="i0">Imprisoned in its chords of vermeil veins:</div>
  <div class="i0">Then, stealing wily from a grove of pines,</div>
  <div class="i0">The Oread, in cincture of green vines;</div>
  <div class="i0">Her cautious feet, fragrant and twinkling wet,</div>
  <div class="i0">Set in a bed of rainy serpolet;</div>
  <div class="i0">Her flower-red lips half-parted in surprise,</div>
  <div class="i0">And expectation in her wondering eyes,</div>
  <div class="i0">As in the bosk a rustling noise she hears&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">A Faun, sly-eyed, with furred and pointed ears,</div>
  <div class="i0">Who leaps upon her, as upon a dove</div>
  <div class="i0">A great hawk pinions from the skies above.</div>
  <div class="i0">Diana sees, and on her wooded hills</div>
  <div class="i0">Stays her fair band, the stag-hounds' clamor stills&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">A senseless statue of cold, weeping stone</div>
  <div class="i0">Fills his embrace; the Oread is gone.</div>
  <div class="i0">The stag-hounds bay; again they urge the chase,</div>
  <div class="i0">While the astonished Faun's bewildered face</div>
  <div class="i0">Paints all his wonderment, and, wondering,</div>
  <div class="i0">He bends above the sculpture of a spring.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">And so we sailed; and many a morn of balm</div>
  <div class="i0">Led on the hours of sunny song and calm:</div>
  <div class="i0">And it was life, to her and me, and love,</div>
  <div class="i0">With the fair myths below, our God above,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">To sail in golden sunsets and emerge</div>
  <div class="i0">In golden morns upon a fretless surge.</div>
  <div class="i0">But, ah! alas! the stars, that pierce the blue,</div>
  <div class="i0">Shine not for ever; clouds must gather, too.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">I knew not how it came, but in a while</div>
  <div class="i0">I found myself cast on a desert isle,</div>
  <div class="i0">Alone with sorrow; wan with doubt and dread;</div>
  <div class="i0">The seas in wrath and thunder overhead;</div>
  <div class="i0">Deep down in coral caves the one I love&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">No myths below; no God, it seemed, above.</div>

  <div class="i0">In Jotunheim, and dragged beneath the world,</div>
  <div class="i0">Into a cave the earthquake's hands had built,</div>
  <div class="i0">A cavern vast and terrible as that,</div>
  <div class="i0">They tell of Hel's, whose ceiling is of snakes,</div>
  <div class="i0">That hang, a torrent torture, yawning slime,</div>
  <div class="i0">In whose slow stream eternal anguish wades.</div>
  <div class="i0">And for his crimes they chained him to a rock,</div>

  <div class="i0">Of ceaseless poison dripping in the gloom.</div>
  <div class="i0">Was it her voice lamenting? or the sound</div>
  <div class="i0">Of far abysmal waters falling, falling</div>
  <div class="i0">Down tortured labyrinths of hollow rock?</div>
  <div class="i0">Or was't the Strömkarl? he whose hoary harp</div>

  <div class="i0">Sits gray behind the crashing cataract,</div>
  <div class="i0">Within a grotto dim with mist and foam;</div>
  <div class="i0">His long thin beard, white as the flying spray,</div>
  <div class="i0">Slow-swinging in the wind and keeping time</div>

  <div class="i0">Of silence speaking to the deeps of night?</div>
  <div class="i0">Sad, sad, and slow, yea slower than sad tears</div>

  <div class="i0">With Berserk fury, shouting, and the hurl</div>
  <div class="i0">And shock of iron spears on iron shields,</div>

  <div class="i0">Fierce vaunter of loud hate, one mighty fist,</div>

  <div class="i0">Headlong for battle-launching, at the gods</div>
  <div class="i0">Clutched mad defiance, madder blasphemy;</div>
  <div class="i0">Yet all unhurled and vain as mists of morn,</div>

  <div class="i0">Into the river slowly flowing by</div>
  <div class="i0">Swiftly she pours the vitriol torture: scarce</div>
  <div class="i0">A tithe of time it takes, but in that time</div>
  <div class="i0">The reptile's vomit slimes his helpless face,</div>
  <div class="i0">Burns to the bone.... All his fierce muscles twist,</div>
  <div class="i0">Wrenching the knotted steel that locks his limbs,</div>
  <div class="i0">And shriek on shriek divides the solitudes.</div>
  <div class="i0">The ocean roars; and, under toppling skies,</div>
  <div class="i0">The mountains avalanche from pine-pierced sides</div>
  <div class="i0">Their centuries of snow. Then all the night</div>

  <div class="i0">O wondrous legends from the storied wells</div>
  <div class="i0">Of lost Baranton! where old Merlin dwells,</div>
  <div class="i0">Nodding a white poll and a grave, gray beard,</div>
  <div class="i0">As if some Lake Ladyé he, listening, heard,</div>
  <div class="i0">Who spake like water, danced like careful showers</div>
  <div class="i0">With blown gold curls through drifts of wild-thorn flowers;</div>
  <div class="i0">Loose, lazy arms upon her bosom crossed,</div>
  <div class="i0">An instant seen, and in an instant lost,</div>
  <div class="i0">With one peculiar note, like that you hear</div>
  <div class="i0">Dropped by a reed-bird when the night is near,</div>
  <div class="i0">A vocal gold blown through the atmosphere.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Lo! dreams from dreams in dreams remembered. Naught</div>
  <div class="i0">That matters much, save that it seemed I thought</div>
  <div class="i0">I wandered dim with some one, but I knew</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Not whom; most beautiful, and young, and true,</div>
  <div class="i0">And pale through suffering: with curl-crowned brow</div>
  <div class="i0">Soft eyes and voice, so strange, they haunt me now&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">A dream, perhaps, in dreamland.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i12">Seemed that she</div>
  <div class="i0">Led me along a flower-showered lea</div>
  <div class="i0">Trammeled with puckered pansy and the pea;</div>
  <div class="i0">Where poppies spread great blood-red stain on stain,</div>
  <div class="i0">So gorged with sunlight and the honeyed rain</div>
  <div class="i0">Their hearts were weary; roses lavished beams;</div>
  <div class="i0">Roses, wherein were huddled little dreams</div>
  <div class="i0">That laughed coy, sidewise merriment, like dew,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or from fair fingers fragrant kisses blew.</div>
  <div class="i0">And suddenly a river cleft the sward;</div>
  <div class="i0">And o'er it lay a mist: and it was hard</div>
  <div class="i0">To see whence came it; whitherward it led;</div>
  <div class="i0">Like some wild, frightened thing, it foamed and fled,</div>
  <div class="i0">Sighing and murmuring, from its fountain-head.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">And following it, at last I came upon</div>
  <div class="i0">The Region of Romance,&mdash;from whence were drawn</div>
  <div class="i0">Its wandering waters,&mdash;and the storied wells</div>
  <div class="i0">Of lost Baranton, where old Merlin dwells,</div>
  <div class="i0">Nodding a white poll and a great, gray beard.</div>
  <div class="i0">And then, far off, a woman's voice I heard,</div>
  <div class="i0">Wilder than water, laughing in the bowers,</div>
  <div class="i0">Like some strange bird: and then, through wild-thorn flowers,</div>
  <div class="i0">I saw her limbs glance, twinkling as spring showers;</div>
  <div class="i0">And then, with blown gold curls, tempestuous tossed,</div>
  <div class="i0">White as a wood-nymph, she a vista crossed,</div>
  <div class="i0">Laughing that laugh wherein there was no cheer,</div>
  <div class="i0">But soulless scorn. And so to me drew near</div>
  <div class="i0">Her sweet lascivious brow's white wonderment,</div>
  <div class="i0">And gray, great eyes, and hair which had the scent</div>
  <div class="i0">Of all the wild Brécèliande's perfumes</div>
  <div class="i0">Drowned in it; and, a flame in gold, one bloom's</div>
  <div class="i0">Blood-point thrust deep. And, "Viviane! Viviane!"</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">The wild seemed crying, as if swept with rain;</div>
  <div class="i0">And all the young leaves laughed; and surge on surge</div>
  <div class="i0">Swept the witch-haunted forest to its verge,</div>
  <div class="i0">That shook and sighed and stammered, as, in sleep,</div>
  <div class="i0">A giant half-aroused: and, with a leap,</div>
  <div class="i0">That samite-hazy creature, blossom-white,</div>
  <div class="i0">Showered mocking kisses down; then, like a light</div>
  <div class="i0">Beat into gusty flutterings by the dawn,</div>
  <div class="i0">Then quenched, she glimmered and, behold, was gone;</div>
  <div class="i0">And in Brécèliande I stood alone</div>
  <div class="i0">Gazing at Merlin, sitting on a stone;</div>
  <div class="i0">Old Merlin, charmed there, dreaming drowsy dreams;</div>
  <div class="i0">A wondrous company; as many as gleams</div>
  <div class="i0">That stab the moted mazes of a beech.</div>
  <div class="i0">And each grave dream, behold, had power to reach</div>
  <div class="i0">My mind through magic; each one following each</div>
  <div class="i0">In dim procession; and their beauty drew</div>
  <div class="i0">Tears down my cheeks, and Merlin's gray cheeks, too,&mdash;</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">One in his beard hung tangled, bright as dew.&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Long pageants seemed to pass me, brave and fair,</div>
  <div class="i0">Of courts and tournaments, with silvery blare</div>
  <div class="i0">Of immaterial trumpets high in air;</div>
  <div class="i0">And blazoned banners, shields, and many a spear</div>
  <div class="i0">Of Uther, waved an incorporeal fear:</div>
  <div class="i0">And forms of Arthur rose and Guenevere,</div>
  <div class="i0">Of Tristram and of Isoud and of Mark,</div>
  <div class="i0">And many others; glimmering in the dark</div>
  <div class="i0">Of Merlin's mind, they rose and glared and then,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">The instant's fostered phantoms,&mdash;passed again.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then all around me seemed a rippling stir</div>
  <div class="i0">Of silken something,&mdash;wilier, lovelier</div>
  <div class="i0">Than that witch-mothered beauty, Viviane,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Approaching with dead knights amid her train,</div>
  <div class="i0">Pale through the vast Brécèliande. And then</div>
  <div class="i0">A knight, steel-helmeted, a man of men,</div>
  <div class="i0">Passed with a fool, King Arthur's Dagonet,</div>
  <div class="i0">Who on his head a tinsel crown had set</div>
  <div class="i0">In mockery. And as he went his way,</div>
  <div class="i0">Behind the knight the leaves began to sway,</div>
  <div class="i0">Then slightly parted&mdash;and Morgane le Fay,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>

  <div class="i0">Of pale-starred green; and where yon fountain shines,</div>
  <div class="i0">Urned deep in tremulous ferns, let's rest upon</div>
  <div class="i0">Yon oak-trunk by the tempest overthrown</div>

  <div class="i0">As that of some wild woman,&mdash;found asleep</div>

  <div class="i0">I dreamed last night thou gather'dst flowers with me,</div>
  <div class="i0">Fairer than those of earth. And I did see</div>
  <div class="i0">How woolly gold they were, how woven through</div>
  <div class="i0">With fluffy flame, and webby with spun dew:</div>
  <div class="i0">And 'Asphodels' I murmured: then, 'These sure</div>
  <div class="i0">Are Eden amaranths, so angel pure</div>
  <div class="i0">That love alone may touch them.'&mdash;Thou didst lay</div>

  <div class="i0">Beyond it, while, around, the wild air shook</div>
  <div class="i0">With torn farewells of pensive melody,</div>
  <div class="i0">Aching with tears and hopeless utterly;</div>
  <div class="i0">So merciless near, meseemed that I did hear</div>

  <div class="i0">Their ingot-cored and gold-crowned hearts, and hush</div>
  <div class="i0">Their voices into silence and to crush:</div>
  <div class="i0">Yet o'er me was a something that restrained:</div>

  <div class="i0">And awful, burning eyes that cowed and held</div>
  <div class="i0">My spirit while that music died or swelled</div>
  <div class="i0">Far out on shoreless waters, borne away&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Like some wild-bird, that, blinded with the ray</div>
  <div class="i0">Of dawn it wings tow'rds, lifting high its crest,</div>
  <div class="i0">The glory round it, sings its heavenliest,</div>

  <div class="i0">And then I knew the flowers which thou hadst given</div>
  <div class="i0">Were strays of parting grief and waifs of heaven</div>
  <div class="i0">For tears and memories. Importunate</div>
  <div class="i0">They spoke to me of loves that separate!&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">But, God! ah God! my God! thus was I left!</div>
  <div class="i0">And these were with me who was so bereft.</div>
  <div class="i0">The haunting torment of that dream of grief</div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">He bowed and wept into his hands; and she,</div>

  <div class="i0">His selle and hunter's head; and at his thigh</div>
  <div class="i0">A good broad hanger; and one hand on high</div>
  <div class="i0">To wind his horn, that startles many a wing,</div>
  <div class="i0">And makes the forest echoes reel and ring.</div>
  <div class="i0">Away, away they flash, a belted band</div>
  <div class="i0">From Camelot, through the haze-haunted land:</div>
  <div class="i0">With many a leamer leashed, and many a hound,</div>
  <div class="i0">With mouths of bell-like music, now that bound,</div>
  <div class="i0">Uncoupled, forward; for, behold! the hart,</div>
  <div class="i0">A ten-tined buck, doth from the covert dart.</div>
  <div class="i0">And the big stag-hounds swing into the chase,</div>
  <div class="i0">The wild horns sing. The pryce seems but a pace</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">On ere 'tis wound. But, see! where interlace</div>
  <div class="i0">The dense-briared thickets, now the hounds have lost</div>
  <div class="i0">The slot, there where their woodland way is crossed</div>
  <div class="i0">By intercepting waters full of leaves.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Beyond, the hart a tangled labyrinth weaves</div>
  <div class="i0">Through deeper boscage; and it seems the sun</div>
  <div class="i0">Makes many shadowy stags of this wild one,</div>
  <div class="i0">That lead in different trails the foresters:</div>
  <div class="i0">And in the trees the ceaseless wind, that stirs,</div>
  <div class="i0">Seems some strange witchcraft, that, with baffling mirth,</div>
  <div class="i0">Mocks them the unbayed hart, and fills the earth</div>
  <div class="i0">With rustling sounds of running.&mdash;Hastening thence,</div>
  <div class="i0">Galloped King Arthur and King Urience,</div>
  <div class="i0">With one small brachet-hound. Now far away</div>
  <div class="i0">They heard their fellowship's faint horns; and day</div>
  <div class="i0">Wore on to noon; yet, there before them, they</div>
  <div class="i0">Still saw the hart plunge bravely through the brake,</div>
  <div class="i0">Leaving the bracken shaking in his wake:</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">And on they followed; on, through many a copse,</div>
  <div class="i0">Above whose brush, close on before, the tops</div>
  <div class="i0">Of the great antlers swelled anon, then, lo,</div>
  <div class="i0">Were gone where beat the heather to and fro.</div>
  <div class="i0">But still they drave him hard; and ever near</div>
  <div class="i0">Seemed that great hart unwearied, and 'twas clear</div>
  <div class="i0">The chase would yet be long, when Arthur's horse</div>
  <div class="i0">Gasped mightily and, lunging in his course,</div>
  <div class="i0">Lay dead, a lordly bay; and Urience</div>
  <div class="i0">Reined his gray hunter, laboring. And thence</div>
  <div class="i0">King Arthur went afoot. When suddenly</div>
  <div class="i0">He was aware of a wide waste of sea,</div>
  <div class="i0">And, near the wood, the hart upon the sward,</div>
  <div class="i0">Bayed, panting unto death and winded hard.</div>
  <div class="i0">So with his sword he slew him; then the pryce</div>
  <div class="i0">Wound loudly on his hunting-bugle thrice.</div>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">As if each echo, which that wild horn's blast</div>
  <div class="i0">Roused from its sleep,&mdash;the solitude had cast</div>
  <div class="i0">For ages on it,&mdash;had, a silvery band</div>
  <div class="i0">Of moving sounds of gladness, hand in hand</div>
  <div class="i0">Arisen,&mdash;each a visible delight,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Came three fair damsels, sunny in snowy white,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">From the red woodland gliding. They the knight,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">For so they deemed the King, who came alone,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Graced with obeisance. And, "Our lord," said one,</div>
  <div class="i0">"Tenders you courtesy until the dawn,</div>
  <div class="i0">The Earl, Sir Damas. For the day is gone,</div>
  <div class="i0">And you are weary. Safe in his strong keep,</div>
  <div class="i0">Led thither with due worship, you shall sleep."</div>
  <div class="i0">And so he came, o'erwearied, to a hall,</div>
  <div class="i0">An owlet-haunted pile, whose weedy wall</div>
  <div class="i0">Towered, rock on rock; its turrets, crowding high,</div>
  <div class="i0">Loomed, ancient as the crags, against a sky</div>
  <div class="i0">Wherein the moon hung, owl-eyed, round and full:</div>
  <div class="i0">An old, gaunt giant-castle, like a gull</div>
  <div class="i0">Hung on the weedy cliffs, where broke the dull</div>
  <div class="i0">Vast monotone of ocean, that uprolled</div>
  <div class="i0">Its windy waters; and where all was old,</div>
  <div class="i0">And sad, and swept of winds, and slain of salt,</div>
  <div class="i0">And haunted grim of ruin: where the vault</div>
  <div class="i0">Of heav'n bent ever, clamorous as the rout</div>
  <div class="i0">Of the defiant headlands, stretching out</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Into the night, with their voluminous shout</div>
  <div class="i0">Of wreck and wrath forever. Arthur then,</div>
  <div class="i0">Among the gaunt Earl's followers, swarthy men,</div>
  <div class="i0">Ate in the wild hall. Then a damsel led,</div>
  <div class="i0">With flaring torch, the tired King to bed,</div>
  <div class="i0">Down lonely labyrinths of that corridored keep.</div>
  <div class="i0">And soon he rested, sunk in heavy sleep.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Then suddenly he woke; it seemed, 'mid groans</div>
  <div class="i0">And dolorous sighs: and round him lay the bones</div>
  <div class="i0">Of many men, and bodies mouldering.</div>
  <div class="i0">And he could hear the wind-swept ocean swing</div>
  <div class="i0">Its sighing surge above. And so he thought,</div>
  <div class="i0">"It is some nightmare weighing me, distraught</div>
  <div class="i0">By that long hunt." And then he sought to shake</div>
  <div class="i0">The horror off and to himself awake.</div>
  <div class="i0">But still he heard sad groans and whispering sighs:</div>
  <div class="i0">And gaunt, from iron-ribbéd cells, the eyes</div>
  <div class="i0">Of pale, cadaverous knights regarded him,</div>
  <div class="i0">Unhappy: and he felt his senses swim</div>
  <div class="i0">With foulness of that dungeon.&mdash;"What are ye?</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Ghosts? or chained champions? or a company</div>
  <div class="i0">Of fiends?" he cried. Then, "Speak! if speak ye can!</div>
  <div class="i0">Speak, in God's name! for I am here&mdash;a man!"</div>
  <div class="i0">Then groaned the shaggy throat of one who lay,</div>
  <div class="i0">A wasted nightmare, dying day by day,</div>
  <div class="i0">Yet once a knight of comeliness, and strong</div>
  <div class="i0">And great and young, but now, through hunger long,</div>
  <div class="i0">A skeleton with hollow hands and cheeks:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"Sir knight," said he, "know that the wretch who speaks</div>
  <div class="i0">Is only one of twenty knights entombed</div>
  <div class="i0">By Damas here; the Earl who so hath doomed</div>
  <div class="i0">Us in this dungeon, where starvation lairs;</div>
  <div class="i0">Around you lie the bones, whence famine stares,</div>
  <div class="i0">Of many knights. And would to God that soon</div>
  <div class="i0">My liberated ghost might see the moon</div>
  <div class="i0">Freed from the horror of this prisonment!"</div>
  <div class="i0">With that he sighed, and round the dungeon went</div>
  <div class="i0">A rustling sigh, as of the damned; and so</div>
  <div class="i0">Another dim, thin voice complained their woe:</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">"Know, he doth starve us to obtain this end:</div>
  <div class="i0">Because not one of us his strength will lend</div>
  <div class="i0">To battle for what still he calls his rights,</div>
  <div class="i0">This castle and its lands. For, of all knights,</div>
  <div class="i0">He is most base; lacks most in hardihood.</div>
  <div class="i0">A younger brother, Ontzlake, hath he; good</div>
  <div class="i0">And courteous; withal most noble; whom</div>
  <div class="i0">This Damas hates&mdash;yea, even seeks his doom;</div>
  <div class="i0">Denying him to his estate all right</div>
  <div class="i0">Save that he holds by main of arms and might.</div>
  <div class="i0">Through puissance hath Ontzlake some few fields</div>
  <div class="i0">And one right sumptuous manor, where he deals</div>
  <div class="i0">With knights as knights should, with an open hand,</div>
  <div class="i0">Though ill he can afford it. Through the land</div>
  <div class="i0">He is far-famed for hospitality.</div>
  <div class="i0">Ontzlake is brave, but Damas cowardly.</div>
  <div class="i0">For Ontzlake would decide with sword and lance,</div>
  <div class="i0">Body to body, this inheritance:</div>
  <div class="i0">But Damas, vile as he is courageless,</div>
  <div class="i0">Doth on all knights, his guests, lay this duress,</div>
  <div class="i0">To fight for him or starve. For you must know</div>
  <div class="i0">That in this country he is hated so</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">There is no champion who will take the fight.</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus fortunes it our plight is such a plight."</div>
  <div class="i0">Quoth he and ceased. And, wondering at the tale,</div>
  <div class="i0">The King lay silent, while each wasted, pale,</div>
  <div class="i0">Poor countenance perused him; then he spake:</div>
  <div class="i0">"And what reward if one this cause should take?"&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"Deliverance for all if of us one</div>
  <div class="i0">Consent to be his party's champion.</div>
  <div class="i0">But treachery and he are so close kin</div>
  <div class="i0">We loathe the part as some misshapen sin;</div>
  <div class="i0">And here would rather with the rats find death</div>
  <div class="i0">Than, serving him, serve wrong, and save our breath,</div>
  <div class="i0">And on our heads, perhaps, bring down God's curse."</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"May God deliver you in mercy, sirs,</div>
  <div class="i0">And help us all!" said Arthur. At which word</div>
  <div class="i0">Straightway a groaning sound of iron was heard,</div>
  <div class="i0">Of chains rushed loose and bolts jarred rusty back,</div>
  <div class="i0">And hoarse the gate croaked open; and the black</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Of that rank cell astonished was with light,</div>
  <div class="i0">That danced fantastic with the frantic night.</div>
  <div class="i0">One high torch, sidewise worried by the gust,</div>
  <div class="i0">Sunned that dark den of hunger, death and dust;</div>
  <div class="i0">And one tall damsel, vaguely vestured, fair,</div>
  <div class="i0">With shadowy hair, poised on the rocky stair:</div>
  <div class="i0">And laughing on the King, "What cheer?" said she.</div>
  <div class="i0">"God's life! the keep stinks vilely! And to see</div>
  <div class="i0">Such noble knights endungeoned, starving here,</div>
  <div class="i0">Doth pain me sore with pity. But, what cheer?"</div>
  <div class="i0">"Thou mockest us. For me, the sorriest</div>
  <div class="i0">Since I was suckled; and of any quest</div>
  <div class="i0">This is the most imperiling and strange.&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">But what wouldst thou?" said Arthur. She, "A change</div>
  <div class="i0">I offer thee; through thee to these with thee,</div>
  <div class="i0">If thou wilt promise, in love's courtesy,</div>
  <div class="i0">To fight for Damas and his brotherhood.</div>
  <div class="i0">And if thou wilt not&mdash;look! behold this brood</div>
  <div class="i0">Of lean and dwindled bellies, spectre-eyed,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Keen knights once,&mdash;who refused me. So decide."</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Then thought the King of the sweet sky, the breeze</div>
  <div class="i0">That blew delirious over waves and trees;</div>
  <div class="i0">Thick fields of grasses and the sunny Earth,</div>
  <div class="i0">Whose beating heat filled the high heart with mirth,</div>
  <div class="i0">And made the world one sovereign pleasure-house</div>
  <div class="i0">Where king and serf might revel and carouse:</div>
  <div class="i0">Then of the hunt on autumn-plaintive hills;</div>
  <div class="i0">Lone forest lodges by their radiant rills;</div>
  <div class="i0">His palace at Caerleon upon Usk,</div>
  <div class="i0">And Camelot's loud halls that through the dusk</div>
  <div class="i0">Blazed far and bloomed, a rose of revelry;</div>
  <div class="i0">Or, in the misty morning, shadowy</div>
  <div class="i0">Loomed, grave with audience. And then he thought</div>
  <div class="i0">Of his Round Table, and the Grael wide sought</div>
  <div class="i0">In haunted holds by many a haunted shore.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then marveled of what wars would rise and roar</div>
  <div class="i0">With dragon heads unconquered and devour</div>
  <div class="i0">This realm of Britain and crush out that flower</div>
  <div class="i0">Of chivalry whence ripened his renown:</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">And then the reign of some besotted crown,</div>
  <div class="i0">Some bandit king of lust, idolatry&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">And with that thought for tears he could not see.&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Then of his best-loved champions, King Ban's son,</div>
  <div class="i0">And Galahad and Tristram, Accolon:</div>
  <div class="i0">And then, ah God! of his loved Guenevere:</div>
  <div class="i0">And with that thought&mdash;to starve 'mid horrors here!&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">For, being unfriend to Arthur and his Court,</div>
  <div class="i0">Well knew he this grim Earl would bless that sport</div>
  <div class="i0">Of fortune which had fortuned him so well</div>
  <div class="i0">As t' have his King to starve within a cell,</div>
  <div class="i0">In the entombing rock beside the deep.&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">And all the life, large in his limbs, did leap</div>
  <div class="i0">Through eager veins and sinews, fierce and red,</div>
  <div class="i0">Stung on to action; and he rose and said:</div>
  <div class="i0">"That which thou askest is right hard, but, lo!</div>
  <div class="i0">To rot here, harder. I will fight his foe.</div>
  <div class="i0">But, mark, I have no weapons and no mail;</div>
  <div class="i0">No steed against that other to avail."</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">She laughed again; "If we must beg or hire,</div>
  <div class="i0">Fear not for that: these thou shalt lack not, sire."</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">And so she led the way; her torch's fire</div>
  <div class="i0">Sprawling with spidery shadows at each stride</div>
  <div class="i0">The cob-webbed coignes of scowling arches wide.</div>
  <div class="i0">At length they reached an iron-studded door,</div>
  <div class="i0">Which she unlocked with one harsh key she bore</div>
  <div class="i0">'Mid many keys bunched at her girdle; thence</div>
  <div class="i0">They issued on a terraced eminence.</div>
  <div class="i0">Below, the sea broke sounding; and the King</div>
  <div class="i0">Breathed open air again that had the sting</div>
  <div class="i0">And scent of brine, the far, blue-billowed foam:</div>
  <div class="i0">And in the east the second dawning's gloam,</div>
  <div class="i0">Since that unlucky chase, was freaked with streaks</div>
  <div class="i0">Red as the ripe stripes of an apple's cheeks.</div>
  <div class="i0">And so, within that larger light of dawn</div>
  <div class="i0">It seemed to Arthur now that he had known</div>
  <div class="i0">This maiden at his Court, and so he asked.</div>
  <div class="i0">But she, well tutored, her real person masked,</div>
  <div class="i0">And answered falsely, "Nay, deceive thee not.</div>
  <div class="i0">Thou saw'st me ne'er at Arthur's Court, I wot.</div>
  <div class="i0">For here it likes me best to sing and spin,</div>
  <div class="i0">And needle hangings, listening to the din</div>
  <div class="i0">Of ocean, sitting some high tower within.</div>
  <div class="i0">No courts or tournaments or hunts I crave,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">No knights to flatter me! For me&mdash;the wave,</div>
  <div class="i0">The cliffs, the sea and sky, in calm or storm;</div>
  <div class="i0">My garth, wherein I walk at morn; the charm</div>
  <div class="i0">Of ocean, redolent at bounteous noon,</div>
  <div class="i0">And sprayed with sunlight; night's free stars and moon:</div>
  <div class="i0">White ships that pass, some several every year;</div>
  <div class="i0">These ancient towers; and those wild mews to hear."</div>
  <div class="i0">"An owlet maid," the King laughed.&mdash;But untrue</div>
  <div class="i0">Was she, and of false Morgane's treasonous crew,</div>
  <div class="i0">Deep in intrigues, even for the slaying of</div>
  <div class="i0">The King, her brother, whom she did not love.&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">And presently she brought him where, in state,</div>
  <div class="i0">This swarthy Damas, 'mid his wildmen sate.</div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">And Accolon, at Castle Chariot still,</div>
  <div class="i0">Had lost long weeks in love. Her husband ill,</div>
  <div class="i0">Morgane, perforce, must leave her lover here</div>
  <div class="i0">Among the hills of Gore. A lodge stood near</div>
  <div class="i0">A cascade in the forest, where their wont</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Was to sit listening the falling fount,</div>
  <div class="i0">That, through sweet talks of many idle hours</div>
  <div class="i0">On moss-banks, varied with the violet flowers,</div>
  <div class="i0">Had learned the lovers' language,&mdash;sighed above,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">And seemed, in every fall, to whisper, "love";</div>
  <div class="i0">That echoed through the lodge, her hands had draped</div>
  <div class="i0">With curious hangings; where were worked and shaped</div>
  <div class="i0">Remembered hours of pleasure, body and soul;</div>
  <div class="i0">Imperishable passions, which made whole</div>
  <div class="i0">The past again in pictures; and could mate</div>
  <div class="i0">The heart with loves long dead; and re-create</div>
  <div class="i0">The very kisses of those perished knights</div>
  <div class="i0">With woven records of long-dead delights.</div>
  <div class="i0">Below the lodge within an urnéd shell</div>
  <div class="i0">The water pooled, and made a tinkling well,</div>
  <div class="i0">Then, slipping thence, through dripping shadows fell</div>
  <div class="i0">From rippling rock to rock. Here Accolon,</div>
  <div class="i0">With Morgane's hollow lute, as eve drew on</div>
  <div class="i0">Came all alone: not ev'n her brindled hound</div>
  <div class="i0">To bound before him o'er the gleaming ground;</div>
  <div class="i0">No handmaid lovely of his loveliest fair,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or paging dwarf in purple with him there;</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Only her lute, about which her perfume</div>
  <div class="i0">Clung, odorous of memories, that made bloom</div>
  <div class="i0">Her absent features, making them arise,</div>
  <div class="i0">Like some rich flower, before his memory's eyes,</div>
  <div class="i0">That seemed to see her lips and to surmise</div>
  <div class="i0">The words they fashioned; then the smile that drank</div>
  <div class="i0">Her soul's deep fire from eyes wherein it sank</div>
  <div class="i0">And slowly waned away to deeper dreams,</div>
  <div class="i0">Fathomless with thought, down in their dove-gray streams.</div>
  <div class="i0">And so for her imagined eyes and lips,</div>
  <div class="i0">Heart-fashioned features, all the music slips</div>
  <div class="i0">Of all his soul, himseems, into his voice,</div>
  <div class="i0">To sing her praises. And, with nervous poise,</div>
  <div class="i0">His fleet, trained fingers waken in her lute</div>
  <div class="i0">Such mellow riot as must make envy-mute</div>
  <div class="i0">The nightingale that listens quivering.</div>
  <div class="i0">And well he hopes that, winging thence, 'twill sing</div>
  <div class="i0">A similar song;&mdash;whose passions burn and pain</div>
  <div class="i0">Its anguished soul, now silent,&mdash;not in vain</div>
  <div class="i0">Beneath her casement, in that garden old</div>
  <div class="i0">Dingled with heavy roses; in the gold</div>
  <div class="i0">Of Camelot's stars and pearl-encrusted moon:</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">And still he hopes the heartache of the tune</div>
  <div class="i0">Will clamor secret memories in her ear,</div>
  <div class="i0">Of life, less dear than death with her not near;</div>
  <div class="i0">Of love, who longs for her, to have her here:</div>
  <div class="i0">Till melt her eyes with tears; and sighs and sobs</div>
  <div class="i0">O'erwhelm her soul, and separation throbs</div>
  <div class="i0">Hard at her heart, that, longing, lifts to death</div>
  <div class="i0">A prayerful pleading, crying, "But a breath,</div>
  <div class="i0">One moment of real heaven, there! in his arms!</div>
  <div class="i0">Close, close! And, for that moment, then these charms,</div>
  <div class="i0">This body, hell, canst have forevermore!"</div>
  <div class="i0">And sweet to know, perhaps its song will pour</div>
  <div class="i0">Into the dull ear of her drowsy lord</div>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">A mighty blade, wrought strangely o'er and o'er</div>

  <div class="i0">Glared venomous, with angry jewels rich.</div>
  <div class="i0">He, louting to the knight, "Sir knight," said he,</div>

  <div class="i0">Then, doffing the great baldric, with the sword,</div>

  <div class="i0">A desperate battle with a champion,</div>
  <div class="i0">Of wondrous prowess, by Sir Accolon:</div>

  <div class="i0">Till, her white hands kissed, he shall kiss her face,</div>
  <div class="i0">Through which his life lives on, and still finds grace."</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus he commanded. And, incontinent,</div>

  <div class="i0">And it befell him thus, the following dawn,</div>
  <div class="i0">As he was wandering on a dew-drenched lawn,</div>
  <div class="i0">Glad with the freshness and elastic health</div>
  <div class="i0">Of sky and earth, that lavished all their wealth</div>
  <div class="i0">Of heady winds and racy scents,&mdash;a knight</div>
  <div class="i0">And gentle lady met him, gay bedight,</div>
  <div class="i0">With following of six esquires; and they</div>
  <div class="i0">Held on gloved wrists the hooded falcon gray,</div>

  <div class="i0">From Ontzlake's manor, where he languished; sore</div>
  <div class="i0">Hurt in the lists, a spear wound in his thigh:</div>
  <div class="i0">Who had besought&mdash;for much he feared to die&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">This knight and his fair lady, as they rode</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">To hawk near Chariot, Morgane's abode,</div>

  <div class="i0">To come to him (for in chirurgery</div>
  <div class="i0">Of all that land she was the greatest leach),</div>
  <div class="i0">And her for his recovery beseech.</div>
  <div class="i0">So, Accolon saluted, they drew rein,</div>
  <div class="i0">And spake their message, for, right over fain</div>
  <div class="i0">Were they toward their sport,&mdash;that he would bear</div>
  <div class="i0">Petition to that lady. But, not there</div>
  <div class="i0">Was Arthur's sister, as they well must wot;</div>
  <div class="i0">But now a sennight lay at Camelot,</div>
  <div class="i0">The guest of Guenevere; and with her there</div>
  <div class="i0">Four other queens of Farther Britain were:</div>
  <div class="i0">Isoud of Ireland, she of Cornwall Queen,</div>
  <div class="i0">King Mark's wife,&mdash;who right rarely then was seen</div>
  <div class="i0">At Court for jealousy of Mark, who knew</div>
  <div class="i0">Her to that lance of Lyonesse how true</div>
  <div class="i0">Since mutual quaffing of a philter; while</div>
  <div class="i0">How guilty Guenevere on such could smile:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">She of Northgales and she of Eastland; and</div>
  <div class="i0">She of the Out Isles Queen. A fairer band,</div>
  <div class="i0">For sovereignty and love and loveliness,</div>
  <div class="i0">Was not in any realm to grace and bless.</div>
  <div class="i0">So Accolon informed them. In distress</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Then quoth that knight: "Ay? see how fortune turns</div>
  <div class="i0">And varies like an April day, that burns</div>
  <div class="i0">Now welkins blue with calm; now scowls them down,</div>
  <div class="i0">Revengeful, with a black storm's wrinkled frown.</div>
  <div class="i0">For, look! this Damas, who so long hath lain</div>
  <div class="i0">A hiding vermin, fearful of all pain,</div>
  <div class="i0">Dark in his bandit towers by the deep,</div>
  <div class="i0">Wakes from a five years' torpor and a sleep,</div>
  <div class="i0">And sends despatch a courier to my lord,</div>
  <div class="i0">Sir Ontzlake, with, 'To-morrow, with the sword,</div>
  <div class="i0">Earl Damas and his knight, at point of lance,</div>
  <div class="i0">Decides the issue of inheritance,</div>
  <div class="i0">Body to body, or by champion.'&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Right hard to find such ere to-morrow dawn.</div>
  <div class="i0">Though sore bestead lies Ontzlake, if he could,</div>
  <div class="i0">He would arise and save his livelihood."</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Then thought Sir Accolon: "One might suppose,</div>

  <div class="i0">Same things befall through Morgane's arts&mdash;who knows?&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Howe'er it be, as 'twere for her own sake,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">This battle I myself will undertake."</div>
  <div class="i0">Then said to those, "I know the good Ontzlake.</div>
  <div class="i0">If he be so conditioned, harried of</div>
  <div class="i0">Estate and life,&mdash;in knighthood and for love</div>
  <div class="i0">Of justice I his quarrel will assume.</div>
  <div class="i0">My limbs are keen for armor. Let the groom</div>
  <div class="i0">Prepare my steed. Right good 'twill be again</div>
  <div class="i0">To feel him under me."&mdash;Then, of that train,</div>
  <div class="i0">Asked that one gentleman with him remain,</div>
  <div class="i0">And men to squire his horse and arms. And then,</div>
  <div class="i0">When this was granted, mounted with his men</div>
  <div class="i0">And thence departed. And, ere noontide, they</div>
  <div class="i0">Came to a lone, dismantled priory</div>
  <div class="i0">Hard by a castle 'gainst whose square, grey towers,</div>
  <div class="i0">Machicolated, mossed, in forest bowers,</div>
  <div class="i0">Full many a siege had beat and onset rushed:</div>
  <div class="i0">A forest fortress, old and deep-imbushed</div>
  <div class="i0">In wild and woody hills. And then one wound</div>
  <div class="i0">A hoarse slug-horn, and at the savage sound</div>
  <div class="i0">The drawbridge rumbled moatward, clanking, and</div>
  <div class="i0">Into a paved court rode that little band.</div>

  <div class="i0">A splinter of sunlight, in the morning's zeal</div>
  <div class="i0">Glittered, its point, as 'twere, a star of steel.&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">A squire attended him; a youth, whose head</div>

  <div class="i0">Cock-feathered cap shone brave: 'neath which, as keen</div>
  <div class="i0">As some wild hawk's, his green-gray eyes were seen:</div>

  <div class="i0">Crashed full the unpierced shields, and horse from horse</div>
  <div class="i0">Lashed, madly pawing.&mdash;And a hoarse roar rang</div>
  <div class="i0">From the loud lists, till far the echoes sang</div>
  <div class="i0">Of hill and rock-hung forest and wild cliff.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Rigid the champions rode where, standing stiff,</div>
  <div class="i0">Their esquires tendered them the spears they held.</div>
  <div class="i0">Again the trumpet blew, and, firmly selled,</div>
  <div class="i0">Forward they galloped, shield to savage shield,</div>
  <div class="i0">And crest to angry crest: the wyvern reeled,</div>
  <div class="i0">Towering, against the griffin: scorn and scath</div>
  <div class="i0">Upon their fiery fronts and in the wrath</div>
  <div class="i0">Of their gem-blazing eyes: each figure stood</div>
  <div class="i0">A symbol of the heart beneath the hood.&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">The lance of Accolon, as on a rock</div>
  <div class="i0">The storm-launched foam breaks baffled, with the shock,</div>
  <div class="i0">On Arthur's sounding shield burst splintered force;</div>
  <div class="i0">But him resistless Arthur's,&mdash;high from horse</div>
  <div class="i0">Uplifted,&mdash;headlong bore, and crashed him down;</div>
  <div class="i0">A long sword's length unsaddled. Accolon</div>
  <div class="i0">For one stunned moment lay. Then, rising, drew</div>
  <div class="i0">The great sword at his hip that shone like dew</div>
  <div class="i0">Smitten with morn. "Descend!" he grimly said,</div>
  <div class="i0">"To proof of better weapons, head to head!</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Enough of spears! to swords!"&mdash;And from his height</div>
  <div class="i0">The King clanged down. And quick, like some swift light,</div>
  <div class="i0">His moon-bright brand unsheathed. And, hollowed high,</div>
  <div class="i0">Each covering shield gleamed, slantwise, to'ards the sky,</div>
  <div class="i0">A blazoned eye of bronze: and underneath,</div>
  <div class="i0">As 'neath two clouds, the lightning and the death</div>
  <div class="i0">Of the fierce swords played. Now a shield descends&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">A long blade leaps;&mdash;and now, a fang that rends,</div>
  <div class="i0">Another blade, loud as a battle word,</div>
  <div class="i0">Beats downward, trenchant; and, resounding heard,</div>
  <div class="i0">A shield's fierce face replies: again a sword</div>
  <div class="i0">Swings for a giant blow, and, balked again,</div>
  <div class="i0">Burns crashing from a sword. Thus, o'er the plain,</div>
  <div class="i0">Over and over, blade on baleful blade;</div>
  <div class="i0">Teeth clenched; and eyes, behind their visors' shade,</div>
  <div class="i0">Like wild beasts' eyes in caverns; shield to shield,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">The champions strove, each scorning still to yield.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Then Arthur drew aside to rest upon</div>
  <div class="i0">His falchion for a space. But Accolon,</div>
  <div class="i0">As yet,&mdash;through virtue of that magic sheath,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Fresh and almighty, and no nearer death</div>
  <div class="i0">Now than when first the fight to death begun,</div>
  <div class="i0">Chafed at delay. But Arthur, with the sun,</div>
  <div class="i0">His heavy mail, his wounds, and loss of blood,</div>
  <div class="i0">Made weary, ceased and for a moment stood</div>
  <div class="i0">Leaning upon his sword. Then, "Dost thou tire?"</div>
  <div class="i0">Sneered Accolon. And then, with fiercer fire,</div>
  <div class="i0">"Defend thee! yield thee! or die recreant!"</div>
  <div class="i0">And at the King aimed a wild blow, aslant,</div>
  <div class="i0">That beat a flying fire from the steel.</div>
  <div class="i0">Stunned by that blow, the King, with brain a-reel,</div>
  <div class="i0">Sank on one knee; then rose, infuriate,</div>
  <div class="i0">Nerved with new vigor; and with heat and hate</div>
  <div class="i0">Gnarled all his strength into one blow of might,</div>
  <div class="i0">And in both fists his huge blade knotted tight,</div>
  <div class="i0">And swung, terrific, for a final stroke,&mdash;</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">And,&mdash;as the lightning flames upon an oak,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Boomed on the burgonet his foeman wore;</div>
  <div class="i0">Hacked through and through its crest, and cleanly shore,</div>
  <div class="i0">With hollow clamor, from his head and ears,</div>
  <div class="i0">The brag and boasting of that griffin fierce:</div>
  <div class="i0">Then, in an instant, as if made of glass,</div>
  <div class="i0">That brittle blade burst, shattered; and the grass</div>
  <div class="i0">Shone, strewn with shards; as 'twere a broken ray,</div>
  <div class="i0">It fell and bright in feverish fragments lay.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then groaned the King, disarmed. And straight he knew</div>
  <div class="i0">This sword was not Excalibur: too true</div>
  <div class="i0">And perfect tempered, runed and mystical,</div>
  <div class="i0">That weapon of old wars! and then withal,</div>
  <div class="i0">Looking upon his foe, who still with stress</div>
  <div class="i0">Fought on, untiring, and with no distress</div>
  <div class="i0">Of wounds or heat, he thought, "I am betrayed!"</div>
  <div class="i0">Then as the sunlight struck along that blade,</div>
  <div class="i0">He knew it, by the hilt, for his own brand,</div>
  <div class="i0">The true Excalibur, that high in hand</div>
  <div class="i0">Now rose avenging. For Sir Accolon</div>
  <div class="i0">In madness urged th' unequal battle on</div>
  <div class="i0">His King defenseless; who, the hilted cross</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Of that false weapon grasped, beneath the boss</div>
  <div class="i0">Of his deep-dented shield crouched; and around,</div>
  <div class="i0">Like some great beetle, labored o'er the ground,</div>
  <div class="i0">Whereon the shards of shattered spears and bits</div>
  <div class="i0">Of shivered steel and gold made sombre fits</div>
  <div class="i0">Of flame, 'mid which, hard-pressed and cowering</div>
  <div class="i0">Beneath his shield's defense, the dauntless King</div>
  <div class="i0">Crawled still defiant. And, devising still</div>
  <div class="i0">How to secure his sword and by what skill,</div>
  <div class="i0">Him thus it fortuned when most desperate:</div>
  <div class="i0">In that close chase they came where, shattered late,</div>
  <div class="i0">Lay, tossed, the truncheon of a bursten lance,</div>
  <div class="i0">Which, deftly seized, to Accolon's advance</div>
  <div class="i0">He wielded with effect. Against the fist</div>
  <div class="i0">Smote, where the gauntlet clasped the nervous wrist,</div>
  <div class="i0">That heaved Excalibur for one last blow;</div>
  <div class="i0">Sudden the palsied sinews of his foe</div>
  <div class="i0">Relaxed in effort, and, the great sword seized,</div>
  <div class="i0">Was wrenched away: and straight the wroth King eased</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Himself of his huge shield, and hurled it far;</div>
  <div class="i0">And clasping in both arms of wiry war</div>
  <div class="i0">His foe, Sir Accolon,&mdash;as one hath seen</div>
  <div class="i0">A strong wind take an ash tree, rocking green,</div>
  <div class="i0">And swing its sappy bulk, then, trunk and boughs,</div>
  <div class="i0">Crash down its thundering height in wild carouse</div>
  <div class="i0">And wrath of tempest,&mdash;so King Arthur shook</div>
  <div class="i0">And headlong flung Sir Accolon. Then took,</div>
  <div class="i0">Tearing away, that scabbard from his side</div>
  <div class="i0">And hurled it through the lists, that far and wide</div>
  <div class="i0">Gulped in the battle breathless. Then, still wroth,</div>
  <div class="i0">He seized Excalibur; and grasped of both</div>
  <div class="i0">Wild hands, swung trenchant, and brought glittering down</div>
  <div class="i0">On rising Accolon. Steel, bone and brawn</div>
  <div class="i0">That blow hewed through. Unsettled every sense.</div>
  <div class="i0">Bathed in a world of blood, his limbs lay tense</div>
  <div class="i0">A moment, then grew limp, relaxed in death.</div>
  <div class="i0">And bending o'er him, from the brow beneath,</div>
  <div class="i0">The King unlaced the helm. When dark, uncasqued,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">The knight's slow eyelids opened, Arthur asked:</div>
  <div class="i0">"Say, ere thou diest, whence and who thou art!</div>
  <div class="i0">What king, what court is thine? And from what part</div>
  <div class="i0">Of Britain dost thou come? Speak!&mdash;for, methinks,</div>
  <div class="i0">I have beheld thee&mdash;where? Some memory links</div>
  <div class="i0">Me strangely with thy face, thy eyes ... thou art&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Who art thou?&mdash;speak!"&mdash;</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i6">He answered, slow, then short,</div>

  <div class="i0">But to what end&mdash;yea, tell me&mdash;am I slain?"&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Then bent King Arthur nearer and again</div>
  <div class="i0">Drew back: then, anguish in his utterance, sighed:</div>
  <div class="i0">"One of my Table!"&mdash;Then asked softly, "Say,</div>
  <div class="i0">Whence hadst thou this, my sword? say, in what way</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Thou cam'st by it?"&mdash;But, wandering, that knight</div>
  <div class="i0">Heard with dull ears, divining but by sight</div>
  <div class="i0">The question asked; and answered, "Woe!&mdash;the sword!&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Woe worth the sword!&mdash;Lean down!&mdash;Canst hear my word?&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">From Morgane! Arthur's sister, who had made</div>
  <div class="i0">Me king of all this kingdom, so she said&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Hadst thou not 'risen, accurséd, like a fate,</div>

  <div class="i0">A king! dost hear?&mdash;a gold and blood-crowned king,</div>
  <div class="i0">I!&mdash;Arthur's sister, queen!&mdash;No bird can wing</div>
  <div class="i0">Higher than her ambition! that resolved</div>
  <div class="i0">Her brother's death was needed, and evolved</div>
  <div class="i0">Plots that should ripen with the ripening year,</div>
  <div class="i0">And here be reaped, perhaps&mdash;nay, nay! not here!&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Farewell, my Morgane!&mdash;Yea, 'twas she who schemed</div>
  <div class="i0">While there at Chariot we loved and dreamed</div>
  <div class="i0">Gone some six months.&mdash;There nothing gave us care.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Each morning was a liberal almoner</div>
  <div class="i0">Prodigal of silver to the earth and air:</div>
  <div class="i0">Each eve, a fiery dragon, cloud-enrolled,</div>
  <div class="i0">Convulsive, dying overwhelmed with gold;</div>
  <div class="i0">On such an eve it was, that, redolent,</div>
  <div class="i0">She sat by me and said,&mdash;'My message sent,</div>

  <div class="i0">Thou and the king!&mdash;my men&mdash;the forest fight!&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Murder perhaps.&mdash;But, well?&mdash;who is to blame?'...</div>
  <div class="i0">So with her blood-red thoughts to me she came.</div>
  <div class="i0">To me! that woman, brighter than a flame,</div>
  <div class="i0">And wooed my soul to hell, with love accurs'd;</div>
  <div class="i0">With harlot lips, from which my being first</div>
  <div class="i0">Drank hell and heaven. She, who was in sooth</div>
  <div class="i0">My heaven and hell.&mdash;But now, behind her youth</div>
  <div class="i0">She shrivels to a hag!&mdash;I see the truth!&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Harlot!&mdash;nay, spouse of Urience, King of Gore!&mdash;</div>

  <div class="i0">A star blaze up in heaven, then cease to be.</div>
  <div class="i0">Slow from his visage he his visor raised,</div>
  <div class="i0">And on the dying knight a moment gazed;</div>
  <div class="i0">Then grimly said, "Look on me, Accolon!</div>

  <div class="i0">Blade-battered as he was, beheld and knew;</div>
  <div class="i0">Strained to his tottering knees; and, gasping, drew</div>
  <div class="i0">Up full his armored height and hoarsely cried,</div>

  <div class="i0">And rot! vile food for kites and carrion crows.</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus much for him!... But all our favor goes</div>
  <div class="i0">Toward Sir Ontzlake, whom it likes the King</div>

  <div class="i0">So did she then determine; on that night</div>
  <div class="i0">Of lonely autumn, when no haggard, white,</div>
  <div class="i0">Wan, watery moon dreamed on the streaming pane;</div>
  <div class="i0">But, on the leads, beat the incessant rain,</div>
  <div class="i0">And the lamenting wind wailed wild among</div>
  <div class="i0">The trees and turrets, like a phantom throng.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">So grew her face severe as skies that take</div>
  <div class="i0">Suggestions of far storm whose thunders shake</div>
  <div class="i0">The distant hills with wrath, and cleave with fire</div>
  <div class="i0">A pine the moaning forest mourns as sire&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">So touched her countenance that dark intent:</div>
  <div class="i0">And in still eyes her thoughts were evident,</div>
  <div class="i0">As in dark waters, luminous and deep,</div>
  <div class="i0">The heavens glass themselves when o'er them sweep</div>
  <div class="i0">The clouds of storm and austere stars they keep,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Ghostly and gray,&mdash;locked in their steadfast gloom.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then, as if some great wind had swept the room,</div>
  <div class="i0">Silent, intense, she rose up from her seat.</div>
  <div class="i0">As if dim arms had made her a retreat,</div>
  <div class="i0">Secret as thought to move in, like a ghost,</div>
  <div class="i0">Noiseless as sleep and subtle as the frost,</div>
  <div class="i0">Poised like a light and borne as carefully,</div>
  <div class="i0">She trod the gusty hall where shadowy</div>
  <div class="i0">The hangings rolled a dim Pendragon war.</div>
  <div class="i0">And there the mail of Urience shone. A star,</div>
  <div class="i0">Glimmering above, a dying cresset dropped</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">From the stone vault and flared. And here she stopped,</div>
  <div class="i0">And took the sword, fresh-burnished by his page,</div>
  <div class="i0">Long as a flame of pale, arrested rage.&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">For she had thought that, when they found him dead,</div>
  <div class="i0">His sword laid by him on the bloody bed</div>
  <div class="i0">Would be convictive that his own hand had</div>
  <div class="i0">Done him this violence when fever-mad.</div>
  <div class="i0">The sword she took; and to the chamber, where</div>
  <div class="i0">King Urience slept, she glided; like an air,</div>
  <div class="i0">Smooth in seductive sendal; or a fit</div>
  <div class="i0">Of faery song, a wicked charm in it,</div>
  <div class="i0">That slays; an incantation full of guile.</div>
  <div class="i0">She paused upon his threshold; for a while</div>
  <div class="i0">Listened; and, sure he slept, stole in and stood</div>
  <div class="i0">Crouched o'er his couch. About her heart the blood</div>
  <div class="i0">Caught, strangling; then rose throbbing, thud on thud,</div>
  <div class="i0">Up to her wide-stretched eyes, and up and up,</div>
  <div class="i0">As wine might, whirling wildly in a cup.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Then came rare Recollection, with a mouth</div>
  <div class="i0">Sweet as the honeyed sunbeams of the South</div>
  <div class="i0">Trickling through perplexed ripples of the leaves;</div>
  <div class="i0">To whose faint form a veil of starshine cleaves</div>
  <div class="i0">Intricate gauze from memoried eyes to feet&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Feet softer than the sifted snows and fleet</div>
  <div class="i0">To come and go and airy anxiously.</div>
  <div class="i0">She, trembling to her, like a flower a bee</div>
  <div class="i0">Nests in and makes an audible mouth of musk,</div>
  <div class="i0">Lisping a downy message to the dusk,</div>
  <div class="i0">Laid lips to ears and languaged memories of</div>
  <div class="i0">Now hateful Urience:&mdash;How her maiden love</div>
  <div class="i0">Had left Caerleon secretly for Gore,</div>
  <div class="i0">With him, one day of autumn. How a boar,</div>
  <div class="i0">Wild as the wildness of the solitude,</div>
  <div class="i0">Raged at her from a cavern of the wood,</div>
  <div class="i0">That, crimson-creepered, yawned the bristling curse</div>
  <div class="i0">Murderous upon her. As her steed grew worse</div>
  <div class="i0">And, terrified, fled snorting down the dell,</div>
  <div class="i0">How she had flung herself from out the selle,</div>
  <div class="i0">In fear, upon a bank of springy moss,</div>
  <div class="i0">Where she lay swooning: in an utter loss</div>
  <div class="i0">Of mind and limbs; wherein she seemed to see,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Or saw in horror, half unconsciously,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">As one who pants beneath an incubus</div>
  <div class="i0">And strives to shriek or move, delirious,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">The monster-thing thrust tow'rds her, tusked and fanged,</div>
  <div class="i0">And hideous snouted: how the whole wood clanged</div>
  <div class="i0">And buzzed and boomed a hundred sounds and lights</div>
  <div class="i0">Lawless about her brain,&mdash;like leaves wild nights</div>
  <div class="i0">Of hurricane harvest, shouting.&mdash;Then it seemed</div>
  <div class="i0">A fury thundered 'twixt them&mdash;and she screamed</div>
  <div class="i0">As round her flew th' uprooted loam that held</div>
  <div class="i0">Leaves, twigs and matted moss; and, clanging, swelled</div>
  <div class="i0">Continual echoes with the thud of strife,</div>
  <div class="i0">And groan of man and brute that warred for life:</div>
  <div class="i0">How all the air, gone mad with foam and forms,</div>
  <div class="i0">Spun froth and, 'twixt her, wrestled hair and arms,</div>
  <div class="i0">And hoofs and feet that crushed the leaves and shred,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Whirling them wildly, brown, and yellow, and red.</div>
  <div class="i0">And how she rose and leaned her throbbing head,</div>
  <div class="i0">With all its uncoifed braids of raven hair</div>
  <div class="i0">Disheveled, on one arm,&mdash;as white and fair</div>
  <div class="i0">And smooth as milk,&mdash;and saw, as through a haze,</div>
  <div class="i0">The brute thing throttled and the frowning face</div>
  <div class="i0">Of Urience bent above it, browed with might;</div>
  <div class="i0">One red swol'n arm, that pinned the hairy fright,</div>
  <div class="i0">Strong as a god's, iron at the gullet's brawn:</div>
  <div class="i0">Dug in its midriff, the close knees, updrawn,</div>
  <div class="i0">Wedged, as with steel, the glutton sides that strove,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">A shaggy bulk,&mdash;with hoofs that drove and drove.</div>
  <div class="i0">And then she saw how Urience swiftly slipped</div>
  <div class="i0">One arm, the monster's tearing tusks had ripped</div>
  <div class="i0">And ribboned redly, to the dagger's hilt,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Which at his hip hung long, its haft gold-gilt;&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Flame-like it flashed; and then, as bright as ice,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Plunged, and replunged; again, now twice, now thrice;</div>
  <div class="i0">And the huge boar, stretched out in sullen death,</div>
  <div class="i0">Lay, bubbling blood, with harsh, laborious breath.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then how he brought her water from a well,</div>
  <div class="i0">That rustled freshly near them as it fell</div>
  <div class="i0">From its full-mantled urn, in his deep casque,</div>
  <div class="i0">And begged her drink; then bathed her brow, a task</div>
  <div class="i0">That had accompanying tears of joy and vows</div>
  <div class="i0">Of love, and intercourse of eyes and brows,</div>
  <div class="i0">And many kisses: then, beneath the boughs,</div>
  <div class="i0">His wound dressed, and her steed still violent</div>
  <div class="i0">From fear, she mounted and behind him bent</div>
  <div class="i0">And clasped him on the same steed; and they went</div>
  <div class="i0">On through the gold wood tow'rds the golden west,</div>
  <div class="i0">Till, on one low hill's forest-covered crest,</div>
  <div class="i0">Gray from the gold, his castle's battlements pressed.</div>
  <div class="i0">And then she felt she'd loved him till had come</div>
  <div class="i0">Fame of the love of Isoud, whom, from home,</div>
  <div class="i0">Tristram had brought across the Irish foam;</div>
  <div class="i0">And Guenevere's for Launcelot of the Lake:</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Then how her thought from these did seem to take</div>
  <div class="i0">Reflex of longing; and within her wake</div>
  <div class="i0">Desire for some great lover who should slake;</div>
  <div class="i0">And such found Accolon.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i8">And then she thought</div>
  <div class="i0">How far she'd fallen, and how darkly fraught</div>
  <div class="i0">With consequence was this. Then what distress</div>
  <div class="i0">Were hers and his&mdash;her lover's&mdash;and success</div>
  <div class="i0">How doubly difficult if, Arthur slain,</div>
  <div class="i0">King Urience lived to assert his right to reign.</div>
  <div class="i0">So she stood pondering with the sword; her lips</div>
  <div class="i0">Breathless, and tight as were her finger-tips</div>
  <div class="i0">About the weapon's hilt. And so she sighed,</div>
  <div class="i0">"Nay, nay! too long hast lived who shouldst have died</div>
  <div class="i0">Even in the womb, my sorrow! who for years</div>
  <div class="i0">Hast leashed my life to thine, a bond of tears,</div>
  <div class="i0">A weight of care, a knot that thus I part!</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus harshly sever! Ugly that thou art</div>
  <div class="i0">Into the elements naked!"</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i11">O'er his heart</div>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Unfleshed, she flung it by her murdered lord,</div>
  <div class="i0">And watched the blood spread darkly through the sheet,</div>
  <div class="i0">And drip, a horror, at impassive feet</div>
  <div class="i0">Pooling the polished oak. Regretless she</div>
  <div class="i0">Stood, and relentless; in her ecstasy</div>
  <div class="i0">A lovely devil: demon crowned, that cried</div>
  <div class="i0">For Accolon, with passion that defied</div>
  <div class="i0">Control in all her senses; clamorous as</div>
  <div class="i0">A torrent in a cavernous mountain pass</div>
  <div class="i0">That sweeps to wreck and ruin; at that hour</div>
  <div class="i0">So swept her longing tow'rds her paramour.</div>
  <div class="i0">Him whom, King Arthur had commanded when</div>
  <div class="i0">Borne from the lists, she should receive again;</div>
  <div class="i0">Her lover, her dear Accolon, as was just,</div>
  <div class="i0">As was but due her for her love&mdash;and lust.</div>
  <div class="i0">And while she stood revolving if her deed's</div>
  <div class="i0">Secret were safe, behold! a noise of steeds,</div>
  <div class="i0">Arms, jingling stirrups, voices loud that cursed</div>
  <div class="i0">Fierce in the northern court. To her, athirst</div>
  <div class="i0">For him her lover, war and power it spoke,</div>
  <div class="i0">Him victor and so king. And then awoke</div>
  <div class="i0">Desire to see and greet him: and she fled,</div>
  <div class="i0">Like some wild spectre, down the stairs; and, red,</div>
  <div class="i0">Burst on a glare of links and glittering mail,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">That shrunk her eyes and made her senses quail.</div>
  <div class="i0">To her a bulk of iron, bearded fierce,</div>
  <div class="i0">Down from a steaming steed into her ears,</div>
  <div class="i0">"This from the King, O Queen!" laughed harsh and hoarse:</div>
  <div class="i0">Two henchmen beckoned, who pitched sheer, with force,</div>
  <div class="i0">Loud clanging at her feet, hacked, hewn, and red,</div>
  <div class="i0">Crusted with blood, a knight in armor&mdash;dead:</div>
  <div class="i0">Her Accolon, flung in his battered arms</div>
  <div class="i0">By what to her seemed fiends and demon forms,</div>
  <div class="i0">Wild-torched, who mocked; then, with the parting scoff,</div>
  <div class="i0">"This from the King!" phantoms in fog, rode off.</div>

  <div class="i0">Some old, unhappy time of long ago,</div>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Beyond the walls, past wood and twilight field,</div>
  <div class="i0">The Usk slipped onward under wharf and wall</div>
  <div class="i0">Of old Caerleon, rolling down, it seemed,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Incarnadined with splendor of the west,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">The heathen blood of all of Arthur's wars.</div>
  <div class="i0">So she had left him; and he stood alone</div>
  <div class="i0">Within the carven casement, where a ray</div>
  <div class="i0">Of sunset laid a bleeding spear athwart</div>
  <div class="i0">The dark oak hall, and, on the arras gaunt</div>
  <div class="i0">A crimson blade of battle red that dripped.&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">And now life's bitterness took Peredur</div>
  <div class="i0">By all his heart's strings, smiting. He would go,</div>
  <div class="i0">Equipped for quest, through all the savagery</div>
  <div class="i0">Of mountain and of forest. And this girl?&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Forget her! and her game of shuttlecock,</div>
  <div class="i0">Of battledore and shuttlecock with his heart,</div>
  <div class="i0">This Angharad! this child the Court had spoiled!</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Now he remembered how he once had ridd'n,</div>
  <div class="i0">Spurring his piebald stallion down the square,</div>
  <div class="i0">Upon the King's quest, and a girl had laughed</div>
  <div class="i0">From some be-dragoned balcony of walls</div>
  <div class="i0">That faced the gateway; and in passing he</div>
  <div class="i0">Had glimpsed her beauty. It was she. And then</div>
  <div class="i0">He thought how she had haunted him for days,</div>
  <div class="i0">For weeks; and how, returning to Caerleon,</div>
  <div class="i0">His long quest ended, how it thus befell:</div>
  <div class="i0">Deep snow had fallen and the winter wood</div>
  <div class="i0">Lay carpeted with silence. And he rode</div>
  <div class="i0">Into a vista where a raven lay</div>
  <div class="i0">Slain of a hawk; some blood-drops dyed the snow.</div>
  <div class="i0">He lost himself in quaint comparisons</div>
  <div class="i0">Of how the sifted drift was as her skin;</div>
  <div class="i0">The raven's feathers as her heavy hair;</div>
  <div class="i0">And in her cheeks the health of maidenhood</div>
  <div class="i0">Red as the blood-drops. So he sat and dreamed:</div>
  <div class="i0">When one rode up in angry steel and spoke</div>
  <div class="i0">Thrice to no answer, and in anger dashed</div>
  <div class="i0">A gauntlet in his face and made at him:</div>
  <div class="i0">And how he slew him and rode over him,</div>
  <div class="i0">Fiercer than fire; then how he returned</div>
  <div class="i0">To find her fairer than their Gwenddolen,&mdash;</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>

  <div class="i0">And one lone night, two years thereafter,&mdash;lost</div>
  <div class="i0">Within a forest wilder than wild Dean;</div>
  <div class="i0">Where neither wind nor water shook the leaves,</div>
  <div class="i0">That hung as turned to stone above the moss</div>
  <div class="i0">And grass, that wrapped the scaly rocks, death-dry,</div>
  <div class="i0">And barren torrents; where he had not found</div>
  <div class="i0">Or man or hut, or slot of boar or deer,</div>
  <div class="i0">Through miles and miles of lamentable trees</div>
  <div class="i0">And twisted thorns; beneath the autumn moon,&mdash;</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">(Pale as a nun's face seen in cloistered walks)&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Above dead tree-tops, like the rugged rock</div>
  <div class="i0">Of melancholy cliffs, he saw wild walls</div>
  <div class="i0">Of some vague castle thrust gray battlements</div>
  <div class="i0">And hoary towers, like a wizard's dream.</div>
  <div class="i0">Great greedy weeds and burrs and briers packed</div>
  <div class="i0">Its moat and roadway: at the very gate</div>
  <div class="i0">Weeds higher than a man; their ancient stalks</div>
  <div class="i0">Devoured with the dust and spider-webs,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or smothered with the slime where croaked the toad.</div>
  <div class="i0">And Peredur against the portal rode,</div>
  <div class="i0">And with his spear-point beat upon its bolts</div>
  <div class="i0">A sounding minute. But no wolf-hound bayed;</div>
  <div class="i0">Only dull echoes of interior walls</div>
  <div class="i0">And hollow rock that arched the empty halls.</div>
  <div class="i0">And once again his truncheon shook the gate</div>
  <div class="i0">And roused a round-eyed owl that screamed and blinked,</div>
  <div class="i0">Like some fierce gargoyle, on the bartizan;</div>
  <div class="i0">And from a crevice, like an omen, hurled</div>
  <div class="i0">A frantic bat. And then he heard a grate,</div>
  <div class="i0">Concealed within the gloomy battlements,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Slide slowly; and a lean, gaunt, red-haired youth,</div>
  <div class="i0">Lit with a link, addressed him. And he saw</div>
  <div class="i0">That famine had sunk hollows in his cheeks,</div>
  <div class="i0">And fixed gaunt misery in mouth and eyes.</div>
  <div class="i0">"What knight art thou?" he asked. "And whence dost come?"&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">And Peredur replied, "First let me in.</div>
  <div class="i0">I am of Arthur's Court. Long have I ridd'n</div>
  <div class="i0">Through miles and miles of melancholy woods.</div>
  <div class="i0">The night begins to storm. And I would rest."</div>
  <div class="i0">Then said the youth, sad mirth about his mouth,</div>
  <div class="i0">"Rest shalt thou; yea: and since thou, haply, hast</div>
  <div class="i0">Fasted all day, thou shalt break bread with us."&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Then he retired from the grated slide:</div>
  <div class="i0">Undid harsh chains and shot back stubborn bolts;</div>
  <div class="i0">And, stiff with rust, the snarling hinges swung.</div>
  <div class="i0">And Peredur rode armed into a court,</div>
  <div class="i0">Neglected, and pathetic with strewn leaves</div>
  <div class="i0">And offal, where the weed and wire-grass</div>
  <div class="i0">Creviced with wisps the loose and broken stones:</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">And overhead, around the mournful walls,</div>
  <div class="i0">Huge oaks thrust ancient boughs of mistletoe</div>
  <div class="i0">And withered leaves, whose twisted wildness seemed</div>
  <div class="i0">The beckoning arms of hunger, and the hands,</div>
  <div class="i0">Hooked and distorted, darkly threatening,</div>
  <div class="i0">Of murder; enemies that, pitiless,</div>
  <div class="i0">Had laid long siege to that old forest hold.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">And he dismounted. And in clanking mail</div>
  <div class="i0">Strode down the hall. And in the hall beheld</div>
  <div class="i0">Youths, lean and auburn-haired, around the hearth;</div>
  <div class="i0">Some eighteen of an equal height, and clad</div>
  <div class="i0">Alike in dingy garments that looked worn</div>
  <div class="i0">And old. And these were like to him who first</div>
  <div class="i0">Had bid him welcome. And they greeted him</div>
  <div class="i0">And took his arms; and bade him to a seat.</div>
  <div class="i0">And then an inner door flung wide; and, lo,</div>
  <div class="i0">Five maidens, like five forest flowers, came;</div>
  <div class="i0">Dark-eyed, dark-haired. Behold, the queen of these</div>
  <div class="i0">Was Angharad. Clad in a ragged robe</div>
  <div class="i0">Of faded satin that had once been rich.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">She looked at Peredur, and he at her:</div>
  <div class="i0">And with glad eyes once more his soul beheld</div>
  <div class="i0">The hair far blacker than the bird that wings</div>
  <div class="i0">Athwart the milk-white moon: the matchless skin,</div>
  <div class="i0">Inviolably white as wind-flowers blown</div>
  <div class="i0">Among the mighty gospels of the trees:</div>
  <div class="i0">And in her cheeks, the rose of maidenhood</div>
  <div class="i0">Red as round berries winter bushes dot</div>
  <div class="i0">The dimpled drift with under loaded boughs.</div>
  <div class="i0">She knew him not, or seemed to; or forgot</div>
  <div class="i0">To speak his name whenas she looked at him</div>
  <div class="i0">And, blushing, welcomed.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i10">And they sat and talked</div>
  <div class="i0">Until the night waxed late. And as they talked</div>
  <div class="i0">He marked that hunger had made hollow haunts</div>
  <div class="i0">Of all their eyes; and so he longed to ask,</div>
  <div class="i0">But courtesy forbade him. Late it grew,</div>
  <div class="i0">And late and later; and at last there came</div>
  <div class="i0">A knocking, and, as shadowy as two ghosts,</div>
  <div class="i0">Two nuns came gliding; sandalled silence in</div>
  <div class="i0">Frail footsteps, and pale caution on pale lips.</div>
  <div class="i0">One brought a jar of wine, and one brought bread,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Six loaves of wheaten flour. And these said,</div>
  <div class="i0">"God bear us witness, Lady, this is all!</div>
  <div class="i0">Now is our Convent barren as thy board;"</div>

  <div class="i0">He felt long sobbings shake it. And he said,</div>
  <div class="i0">"Tell me, my sister, wherefore dost thou weep?"</div>
  <div class="i0">And Angharad, "Yea; I will tell it thee.&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">My name is Angharad. My father held</div>
  <div class="i0">An Earldom under Arthur, yea, the first</div>
  <div class="i0">In all his Kingdom: and this Castle, too,</div>
  <div class="i0">Was his with cantrevs to the west and east.</div>
  <div class="i0">When I was but a girl Earl Addanc met</div>
  <div class="i0">And loved me. Once, when hunting, he came here</div>
  <div class="i0">And sought my father and demanded me.</div>
  <div class="i0">He said he loved me, and would have but me</div>
  <div class="i0">To grace his bed and board, this Earl! But I&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">I did not love him, being but a child,</div>
  <div class="i0">My father's only child; I could not love.</div>
  <div class="i0">And so my father said this should not be.</div>
  <div class="i0">The Earl was wroth. I heard his furious stride</div>
  <div class="i0">Beneath my casement; double demons pinched</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">His evil eyes and twenty gnarled his face.</div>
  <div class="i0">He cursed us ere he rode beyond our walls</div>
  <div class="i0">Then to Caerleon was I sent; and there</div>
  <div class="i0">Became a woman of young Gwenhwyvar,</div>
  <div class="i0">Until my father's death two years agone,</div>
  <div class="i0">When I returned, a Countess, to find war</div>
  <div class="i0">And Addanc here around beleaguered walls.</div>
  <div class="i0">So hath he stripped me of my appanage;</div>
  <div class="i0">Save this one keep, whose strength hath held out long,</div>
  <div class="i0">Manned by my foster brothers, brave and young,</div>
  <div class="i0">Strong to endure, but lacking still in arms;</div>
  <div class="i0">No match for knights like Addanc. Thou hast met</div>
  <div class="i0">The eighteen youths whose valor will not yield.</div>
  <div class="i0">But what avail their valor and their will</div>
  <div class="i0">Against hard hunger, now our larder lacks,</div>
  <div class="i0">And lacks the Convent, too, whereon we leaned?</div>
  <div class="i0">And Addanc comes to-morrow morn; the truce</div>
  <div class="i0">For our one day's deliberation done.</div>
  <div class="i0">If he prevail&mdash;the thought is like hot hands</div>
  <div class="i0">Here on my brain!&mdash;his oath is 'that the night</div>

  <div class="i0">If he be early, call me not too late.</div>
  <div class="i0">Fear not. I will not go until my sword</div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">A morning gray with mist that gathered drops</div>
  <div class="i0">Of drizzle on the ever dripping leaves.</div>
  <div class="i0">And then the mist divided: ghostly mail,</div>
  <div class="i0">Spears and limp pennons, and the shadowy steeds</div>
  <div class="i0">Of shadowy knights and chieftains. And it seemed</div>
  <div class="i0">A host of phantoms come to lay dim siege</div>
  <div class="i0">To phantom walls whose warriors were ghosts.</div>
  <div class="i0">Afar a bugle flourished in the fog,</div>
  <div class="i0">Disconsolate; no echo of the wood</div>
  <div class="i0">To bear its music burden. To the moat</div>
  <div class="i0">Advanced a herald. And within the wall</div>
  <div class="i0">The grate was opened; and the gaunt-eyed youth</div>
  <div class="i0">Held parley with him: "How the Earl would make</div>
  <div class="i0">End of the long dispute to-day, and leave,</div>
  <div class="i0">'Twixt three a single combat to decide."</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">So Peredur bade arm him, and prepare</div>
  <div class="i0">His horse for battle; and bade give the Earl</div>
  <div class="i0">His answer for the Castle: "That one knight</div>
  <div class="i0">Would try the hauberks of the banded three."</div>
  <div class="i0">And he rode forth: and one rode up and scoffed,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">A knight in russet armor with loud words,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"Small means to large results, forsooth! Thou boast!</div>
  <div class="i0">A vicious palate hath thy appetite</div>
  <div class="i0">That feasted long with hunger and must now</div>
  <div class="i0">Conclude the banquet with three deaths!&mdash;Sir Death,</div>
  <div class="i0">Here is thy death!" and hacked at Peredur</div>
  <div class="i0">A heavy stroke that gashed his chain camail.</div>
  <div class="i0">But, rising in stiff stirrups, ere he passed,</div>
  <div class="i0">Two-handed swung the sword of Peredur,</div>
  <div class="i0">And helm and head of him who fell were twain,</div>
  <div class="i0">Halved like an apple. And the walls were glad.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Then came another, clad in silver mail,</div>
  <div class="i0">As he were Galahad; and in the mist</div>
  <div class="i0">Glimmered like moonlight. And with levelled spear</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Demanded: "Whence and what art thou? this stroke</div>
  <div class="i0">Was never fathered by long fasting."&mdash;Then</div>
  <div class="i0">Quoth Peredur, "I am of Arthur's Court."&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Then sneered the other with a mocking laugh,</div>
  <div class="i0">"A goodly service truly that of his,</div>
  <div class="i0">Since all his knights, whom I have met, have died!"&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Quoth Peredur: "Thy falsehood choke thee dead!</div>
  <div class="i0">Within thy throat thus do I nail thy lie!"</div>
  <div class="i0">And at his gorget hurled his ponderous spear,</div>
  <div class="i0">Ere that one met him, spurring at full speed,</div>
  <div class="i0">Disdainful. And the desperate stroke of him</div>
  <div class="i0">Who had wrought havoc with the Table Round,</div>
  <div class="i0">Glanced shattering from the sloping shield, while he,</div>
  <div class="i0">Bent backwards o'er his saddle, rolled&mdash;his tongue</div>
  <div class="i0">Cleft at the root. And all the walls were glad.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Now came a third: a black knight and a black</div>
  <div class="i0">Enormous steed. No words he wasted. But,</div>
  <div class="i0">The fierce spears splintered, from the baldrics burned</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Swift blades: and Battle held his breath a while</div>
  <div class="i0">To see the great shields rock beneath great blows,</div>
  <div class="i0">Oppose, deploy, as hilt to hilt they hewed</div>
  <div class="i0">At heaume and gorget. While the conflict dripped</div>
  <div class="i0">Between the splintered greaves from many wounds.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then Peredur, his whole strength wrenching at</div>
  <div class="i0">Unyielding shelter of his foeman's shield,</div>
  <div class="i0">Beat down his guard and smote.&mdash;And Addanc lay</div>
  <div class="i0">Beneath the son of Evrawc, whose swift hands</div>
  <div class="i0">Razed off his casque and laid a blind blade bare</div>
  <div class="i0">Across hot eyes, and set a heel of steel</div>
  <div class="i0">Upon his throat and said: "Thou coward curse!</div>
  <div class="i0">What woman wilt thou war with now?&mdash;'Tis well</div>
  <div class="i0">Thy features are thus evil and might breed</div>
  <div class="i0">Nightmares among the kestrels, kites, and crows,</div>
  <div class="i0">Else hadst thou been, ere this,&mdash;so says my sword,&mdash;</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">A head the shorter! and that head hung high</div>
  <div class="i0">Upon the highest battlement. What now!</div>
  <div class="i0">What wilt thou do for thy vile life? what now!</div>
  <div class="i0">Speak! or I smite! O thou base villainy,</div>
  <div class="i0">Out on thy ugly mouth!&mdash;Speak!" Cursing, he,</div>
  <div class="i0">A stricken bulk, growled, "Let me live! And I,</div>
  <div class="i0">Upon my knighthood, swear that I will make</div>
  <div class="i0">Unto this woman, Angharad, returns</div>
  <div class="i0">For all her losses. Let me live."&mdash;And so</div>
  <div class="i0">The sword slid from his eyes and from his neck</div>
  <div class="i0">The heel. And he arose&mdash;to make in full</div>
  <div class="i0">Due restitution of her lands to her</div>
  <div class="i0">He had so robbed and harassed. And in time</div>
  <div class="i0">This was fulfilled.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i10">But Peredur remained,&mdash;</div>

  <div class="i0">Acknowledged her with all obedience.</div>
  <div class="i0">Her rights established, what more now remained</div>
  <div class="i0">To lend excuse unto his long delay?&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">And so he went to her, and led her from</div>

  <div class="i0">Gaunt guardians of Mark's boundary lines,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Gray watch-towers, hawk-like, overhung;</div>

  <div class="i0">For bandits, and a robber-hold</div>
  <div class="i0">Of lust, beside a torrent's wave.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then o'er a bridge, whose granite arched</div>
  <div class="i0">The torrent's foam, she saw a knight,&mdash;</div>

  <div class="i0">Past leagues of unsailed water</div>
  <div class="i0">There reigned a king whose daughter</div>
  <div class="i1">Was fair as a starry stone.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">The Northern Lights were daylight,</div>
  <div class="i1">And day was twilight there:</div>
  <div class="i0">The king was wise and hoary,</div>

  <div class="i1">Of seven kingdoms, fair.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">The day was dim as moonlight;</div>
  <div class="i1">The night was misty gray,</div>

  <div class="i1">A page like the month of May.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">His face was white as moonlight,</div>
  <div class="i1">His hair, a crumpled gold:</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Oh, she was wise as youth is,</div>
  <div class="i0">And he was young as truth is,</div>
  <div class="i1">And the king was old, was old.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">When day grew out of the moonlight,</div>
  <div class="i1">Across the misty wold,</div>
  <div class="i0">A-hunting or a-hawking</div>
  <div class="i0">They rode, forever mocking</div>
  <div class="i1">The good gray king and old.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">At night, in mist and moonlight,</div>
  <div class="i1">Where hung the horns and whips,</div>
  <div class="i0">In courts to the kennels leading,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or where the hounds were feeding,</div>
  <div class="i1">He kissed her eyes and lips.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">They whispered in the moonlight,</div>
  <div class="i1">And kissed in moon and mist:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"Enough! we're done with hiding!"&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">There came the old king riding,</div>
  <div class="i1">The hawk upon his wrist.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Oh, fain was she and eager,</div>
  <div class="i1">And he was over fain;&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"His cup and couch are ready."&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"Then let thy hand be steady&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i1">And he'll not wake again."</div>

  <div class="i0">Is it the mist or moonlight?</div>
  <div class="i1">Or a dead face staring up?&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">The old king's couch was ready,</div>
  <div class="i0">And his daughter's hand was steady</div>
  <div class="i1">Giving the poisoned cup.</div>

  <div class="i1">I met him here at Ammendorf one spring.</div>
  <div class="i0">It was the end of April and the Harz,</div>
  <div class="i0">Treed to their ruin-crested summits, seemed</div>
  <div class="i0">One pulse of tender green and delicate gold,</div>
  <div class="i0">Beneath a heaven that was like the face</div>
  <div class="i0">Of girlhood waking into motherhood.</div>
  <div class="i0">Along the furrowed meadow, freshly ploughed,</div>
  <div class="i0">The patient oxen, loamy to the knees,</div>
  <div class="i0">Plodded or lowed or snuffed the fragrant soil;</div>
  <div class="i0">And in each thorn-tree hedge the wild bird sang</div>
  <div class="i0">A song to spring, full of its own wild self</div>
  <div class="i0">And soul, that heard the blossom-laden May's</div>
  <div class="i0">Heart beating like a star at break of day,</div>
  <div class="i0">As, kissing red the roses, she drew near,</div>
  <div class="i0">Her mouth's ripe rose all dewdrops and perfume.</div>
  <div class="i0">Here at this inn and underneath this tree</div>
  <div class="i0">We took our wine, the morning prismed in its</div>
  <div class="i0">Flame-crystalled gold.&mdash;A goodly vintage that!</div>
  <div class="i0">Tang with the ripeness of full twenty years.</div>
  <div class="i0">Rare! I remember! wine that spurred the blood,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">That brought the heart glad to the songful lip,</div>

  <div class="i0">A man's true soul smiled, breezy as the blue.</div>
  <div class="i0">As royal a Rhenish, I will vouch to say,</div>
  <div class="i0">As that, old legends tell, which Necromance</div>
  <div class="i0">And Magic keep, gnome-guarded, in huge casks</div>
  <div class="i0">Of antique make deep in the Kyffhäuser,</div>
  <div class="i0">Webbed, frosty gray, with salt-petre and mold,</div>
  <div class="i0">The Cellar of the Knights near Sittendorf.&mdash;</div>

  <div class="i2">So solaced by that wine we sat an hour</div>
  <div class="i1">He told me his intent in coming here.</div>

  <div class="i1">Franconia; but no word of parentage:</div>
  <div class="i1">Only his mind to don the buff and green</div>
  <div class="i1">And live a forester with us and be</div>
  <div class="i1">Enfellowed in the Duke of Brunswick's train,</div>
  <div class="i1">And for the Duke's estate even now was bound.</div>

  <div class="i0">And lithe of limb; and with a face that seemed</div>
  <div class="i0">Hope's counterpart&mdash;but with the eyes of doubt:</div>
  <div class="i0">Deep stealthy disks, instinct with starless night,</div>
  <div class="i0">That seemed to say, "We're sure of Earth&mdash;at least</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>

  <div class="i0">Nay! ransack not to-morrow till to-day</div>
  <div class="i0">Lest it engulf thy joy before it is!"&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">And when he spoke, the fire in his eyes</div>
  <div class="i0">Worked restless as a hunted animal's;</div>
  <div class="i0">Or like the Count von Hackelnburg's,&mdash;the eyes</div>
  <div class="i0">Of the Wild Huntsman,&mdash;his that turn and turn</div>
  <div class="i0">Feeling the unseen presence of a fiend.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">And then his smile! a thrust-like thing that curled</div>
  <div class="i0">His lips with heresy and incredible lore</div>
  <div class="i0">When Christ's or th' Virgin's holy name was said,</div>
  <div class="i0">Exclaimed in reverence or admonishment:</div>
  <div class="i0">And once he sneered,&mdash;"What is this God you mouth,</div>
  <div class="i0">Employ whose name to bless yourselves or damn?</div>
  <div class="i0">A curse or blessing?&mdash;It hath passed my skill</div>
  <div class="i0">T' interpret what He is. And then your faith&mdash;</div>

  <div class="i0">Give me the Devil in all mercy then,</div>

  <div class="i0">These be thy care, Kurt: and if not too deep</div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">A year thereafter was it that I heard</div>

  <div class="i0">Then their betrothal. And it was from this,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">(How her fair memory haunts my old heart still!&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Sweet Ilsabe! whose higher womanhood,</div>
  <div class="i0">True as the touchstone which philosophers feign</div>
  <div class="i0">Transmutes to gold base metals it may touch,</div>
  <div class="i0">Had turned to good all evil in this man,)&mdash;</div>

  <div class="i0">Commissioned proxy, his commissioner&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">To test the marksmanship of Rudolf, who</div>
  <div class="i0">Succeeded Kurt with marriage of his child,</div>

 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">Kuno, once in the Knight of Wippach's train,</div>
  <div class="i0">Rode on a grand hunt with the Duke, who came,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Grandfather of the father of our Duke,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">With much magnificence of knights and squires,</div>
  <div class="i0">Great velvet-vestured nobles, cloaked and plumed,</div>
  <div class="i0">To hunt Thuringian deer. Then morn,&mdash;so rathe</div>
  <div class="i0">To bid good-morrow to the husbandman</div>
  <div class="i0">Heavy with slumber,&mdash;was too slow for these,</div>
  <div class="i0">And on the wind-trod hills recumbent yawned</div>
  <div class="i0">Aroused an hour too soon: ashamed, disrobed,</div>
  <div class="i0">Rubbed the stiff sleep from eyes that still would close;</div>
  <div class="i0">Like some young milkmaid whom the cock hath waked,</div>
  <div class="i0">Who sits within her loft and, half asleep,</div>
  <div class="i0">Stretches and hears the house below her stir,</div>
  <div class="i0">Yet sits and yawns, reluctant still to rise.&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Horns sang and deer-hounds tugged a whimpering leash,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Or, loosened, bounded through the baying glens:</div>
  <div class="i0">And ere the mountain mists, compact of white,</div>
  <div class="i0">Broke wild before the azure spears of day,</div>
  <div class="i0">The far-off hunt, that woke the woods to life,</div>
  <div class="i0">Seemed but the heart-beat of the ancient hills.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">And then, near noon, within a forest brake,</div>
  <div class="i0">The ban-dogs roused a red gigantic stag,</div>
  <div class="i0">Lashed to whose back with gnarly-knotted cords,</div>
  <div class="i0">And borne along like some pale parasite,</div>
  <div class="i0">A man shrieked: tangle-bearded, and his hair</div>
  <div class="i0">A mane of forest-burrs. The man himself,</div>
  <div class="i0">Emaciated and half-naked from</div>
  <div class="i0">The stag's mad flight through headlong rocks and trees,</div>
  <div class="i0">One bleeding bruise, his eyes two holes of fire.</div>
  <div class="i0">For such the law then: when the peasant chased</div>
  <div class="i0">Or slew the dun deer of his tyrant lords,</div>
  <div class="i0">If caught, as punishment the withes and spine</div>
  <div class="i0">Of some strong stag, a gift to him of game</div>
  <div class="i0">Enough till death&mdash;death in the antlered herd,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or slow starvation in the haggard hills.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then was the great Duke glad, and forthwith cried</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">To all his hunting-train a rich reward</div>
  <div class="i0">For him who slew the stag and saved the man,</div>
  <div class="i0">But death for him who slew both man and beast.</div>
  <div class="i0">So plunged the hunt after the hurrying slot,</div>
  <div class="i0">A shout and glimmer through the sounding woods,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Like some wild torrent that the hills have loosed,</div>
  <div class="i0">Death for its goal.&mdash;'Twas late; and none had yet</div>
  <div class="i0">Risked that hard shot,&mdash;too desperate the risk</div>
  <div class="i0">Beside the poor life and a little gold,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">When this young Kuno, with hot eyes, wherein</div>
  <div class="i0">Hunt and impatience kindled reckless flame,</div>
  <div class="i0">Cried, "Has the dew made wet each powder-pan?</div>
  <div class="i0">Or have we left our marksmanship at home?</div>
  <div class="i0">Here's for its heart! the Fiend direct my ball!"&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">And fired into a covert packed with briers,</div>
  <div class="i0">An intertangled wall of matted night,</div>
  <div class="i0">Wherein the eye might vainly strive and strive</div>
  <div class="i0">To pierce one fathom, gaze one foot beyond:</div>
  <div class="i0">But, ha! the huge stag staggered from the brake,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Heart-hit, and fell: and that wan wretch, unbound,</div>
  <div class="i0">Rescued, was cared for. Then his grace, the Duke,</div>
  <div class="i0">Charmed with the eagle aim, called Kuno up,</div>
  <div class="i0">And there to him and his forever gave</div>
  <div class="i0">The forest-keepership.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i7">But envious tongues</div>
  <div class="i0">Were soon at wag; and whispered went the tale</div>
  <div class="i0">Of how the shot was "free"; and how the balls</div>
  <div class="i0">Used by young Kuno were "free" bullets&mdash;which</div>
  <div class="i0">To say is: Lead by magic molded, in</div>
  <div class="i0">The presence and directed of the Fiend.</div>
  <div class="i0">Of some effect these tales, and of some force</div>
  <div class="i0">Even with the Duke, who lent an ear so far</div>
  <div class="i0">As to ordain Kuno's descendants all</div>
  <div class="i0">To proof of skill ere their succession to</div>
  <div class="i0">The father's office. Kurt himself hath shot</div>
  <div class="i0">The silver ring out o' the popinjay's beak&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">A good shot he, you see, who would succeed.</div>

 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">Enough! these wives' tales told, to what I've seen:</div>
  <div class="i0">To Ammendorf I came; and Rudolf here</div>
  <div class="i0">With Kurt and his assembled men in buff</div>
  <div class="i0">And woodland green were gathered at this inn.</div>
  <div class="i0">The abundant Year&mdash;like some sweet wife,&mdash;a-smile</div>
  <div class="i0">At her brown baby, Autumn, in her arms,</div>
  <div class="i0">Stood 'mid the garnered harvests of her fields</div>
  <div class="i0">Dreaming of days that pass like almoners</div>
  <div class="i0">Scattering their alms in minted gold of flowers;</div>
  <div class="i0">Of nights, that forest all the skies with stars,</div>
  <div class="i0">Wherethrough the moon&mdash;bare-bosomed huntress&mdash;rides,</div>
  <div class="i0">One cloud before her like a flying fawn.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then I proposed the season's hunt; till eve</div>
  <div class="i0">The test of Rudolf's skill postponed; at which</div>
  <div class="i0">He seemed embarrassed. And 'twas then I heard</div>
  <div class="i0">How he an execrable marksman was;</div>
  <div class="i0">And tales that told of close, incredible shots,</div>
  <div class="i0">That missed their mark; or how the flint-lock oft</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Flamed harmless powder, while the curious deer</div>
  <div class="i0">Stood staring, as in pity of such aim,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or as inviting him to try once more.</div>
  <div class="i0">Howbeit, he that day acquitted him</div>
  <div class="i0">Of all this gossip; in that day's long hunt</div>
  <div class="i0">Missing no shot, however rashly made</div>
  <div class="i0">Or distant through the intercepting trees.</div>
  <div class="i0">And the piled, various game brought down of all</div>
  <div class="i0">Good marksmen of Kurt's train had not sufficed,</div>
  <div class="i0">Doubled, nay, trebled, there to match his heap.</div>
  <div class="i0">And marvelling the hunters saw, nor knew</div>
  <div class="i0">How to excuse them. My indulgence giv'n,</div>
  <div class="i0">Some told me that but yesterday old Kurt</div>
  <div class="i0">Had made his daughter weep and Rudolf frown,</div>
  <div class="i0">By vowing end to their betrothéd love,</div>
  <div class="i0">Unless that love developed better skill</div>
  <div class="i0">Against the morrow's test; his ancestors'</div>
  <div class="i0">High fame should not be tarnished. So he railed;</div>
  <div class="i0">Then bowed his gray head and sat moodily:</div>
  <div class="i0">But, looking up, forgave all when he saw</div>
  <div class="i0">Tears in his daughter's eyes and Rudolf gone</div>
  <div class="i0">Out in the night, black with approaching storm.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
  <div class="i1">Before this inn, crowding the green, they stood,</div>
  <div class="i0">The holiday village come to view the trial:</div>
  <div class="i0">Fair maidens and their comely mothers with</div>
  <div class="i0">Their sweethearts and their husbands. And I marked</div>
  <div class="i0">Kurt and his daughter here; his florid face</div>
  <div class="i0">All creased with smiles at Rudolf's great success;</div>
  <div class="i0">Hers, radiant with happiness; for this</div>
  <div class="i0">Her marriage eve&mdash;so had her father said&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Should Rudolf come successful from the hunt.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">So pleased was I with what I'd seen him do,</div>
  <div class="i0">The trial of skill superfluous seemed; and so</div>
  <div class="i0">Was on the bare brink of announcing, when</div>
  <div class="i0">Out of the western heaven's deepening red,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Like a white message dropped of scarlet lips,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">A wild dove clove the luminous winds and there,</div>
  <div class="i0">Upon that limb, a peaceful moment sat.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then I, "Thy rifle, Rudolf! pierce its head!"</div>
  <div class="i0">Cried pointing, "and chief-forester art thou!"</div>
  <div class="i0">Why did he falter with a face as strange</div>
  <div class="i0">And strained as terror's? did his soul divine</div>
  <div class="i0">What was to be, with tragic prescience?&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">What a bad dream it all seems now!&mdash;Again</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">I see him aim. Again I hear her cry,</div>
  <div class="i0">"My dove! O Rudolf, do not kill my dove!"</div>
  <div class="i0">And from the crowd, like some sweet dove herself,</div>
  <div class="i0">A fluttering whiteness, rushed our Ilsabe&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Too late! the rifle cracked.... The unhurt dove</div>
  <div class="i0">Rose, beating frightened wings&mdash;but Ilsabe!...</div>
  <div class="i0">My God! the sight!... fell smitten; sudden red,</div>
  <div class="i0">Sullying the whiteness of her bridal bodice,</div>
  <div class="i0">Showed where the ball had pierced her innocent heart.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">And Rudolf?&mdash;Ah, of him you still would know?</div>
  <div class="i0">&mdash;When he beheld this thing which he had done,</div>
  <div class="i0">Why, he went mad&mdash;I say&mdash;but others not.</div>
  <div class="i0">An hour he raved of how her life had paid</div>
  <div class="i0">For the unholy missiles he had used,</div>
  <div class="i0">And how his soul was three times lost and damned.</div>
  <div class="i0">I say that he went mad and fled forthwith</div>
  <div class="i0">Into the haunted Harz.&mdash;Some say, to die</div>
  <div class="i0">The prey of demons of the Dummburg ruin.</div>

  <div class="i0">On his tomb.&mdash;Long years, since my lord, Sir Hugh,</div>
  <div class="i0">Lived, and I was his favorite page,</div>
  <div class="i0">And the thing then happened; and he of an age</div>
  <div class="i0">When a man will love and be loved again,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Or off to the wars or a monastery;</div>
  <div class="i0">Or toil till he deaden his heart's hard pain;</div>

 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">I was his page. And often we fared</div>
  <div class="i0">Through the Clare demesne, in autumn, hawking&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">If the Baron had known, how they would have glared,</div>
  <div class="i0">'Neath their bushy brows, those eyes of mocking!&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">That last of the Strongbows, Richard, I mean&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">And growling some six of his henchmen lean</div>
  <div class="i0">To mount and after this Clifford and hang</div>
  <div class="i0">With his crop-eared page to the nearest oak,</div>
  <div class="i0">How he would have cursed us while he spoke!</div>
  <div class="i0">For Clare and Clifford had ever a fang</div>
  <div class="i0">In the other's side.... And I hear the clang</div>
  <div class="i0">Of his rage in the hall when the hawker told&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">If he told!&mdash;how we met on the autumn wold</div>
  <div class="i0">His daughter, sweet Clara of Clare, the day</div>
  <div class="i0">Her hooded tiercel its brails did burst,</div>
  <div class="i0">And trailing its jesses, came flying our way&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">An untrained haggard the falconer cursed</div>
  <div class="i0">While he tried to secure:&mdash;as the eyas flew</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Slant, low and heavily over us, Hugh,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Who saw it coming, and had just then cast</div>
  <div class="i0">His peregrine hawk at a heron quarry,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">In his saddle rising thus, as it passed</div>
  <div class="i0">By the jesses caught, and to her did carry,</div>
  <div class="i0">Where she stood near the wood. Her face flushed rose</div>
  <div class="i0">With the glad of the meeting.&mdash;No two foes</div>
  <div class="i0">Her eyes and my lord's, I swear, who saw</div>
  <div class="i0">'Twas love from the start.&mdash;And I heard him speak;</div>
  <div class="i0">Dismount, then kneel&mdash;and the sombre shaw,</div>
  <div class="i0">With the sad of the autumn waste and bleak,</div>
  <div class="i0">Grew spring with her smile, as the hawk she took</div>
  <div class="i0">On her slender wrist, where it pruned and shook</div>
  <div class="i0">Its callowness. Then I saw him seize</div>
  <div class="i0">The hand that she reached to him, long and white,</div>
  <div class="i0">As she smilingly bade him rise from his knees&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">When he kissed her fingers her eyes grew bright.</div>
  <div class="i0">But her cheeks were pallid when, lashing through</div>
  <div class="i0">The thicket there, his face a-flare</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">With the sting of the wind, and his gipsy hair</div>
  <div class="i0">Flying, the falconer came, and two</div>
  <div class="i0">Or three of the people of Castle Clare.</div>
  <div class="i0">And the leaves of the autumn made a frame</div>
  <div class="i0">For the picture there in the morning's flame.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">What was said in that moment I do not know,</div>

  <div class="i0">Soft as a leaf that swings and hovers,</div>
  <div class="i0">A twinkling gold, when the woods are yellow.</div>
  <div class="i0">And her face with the joy was still aglow</div>
  <div class="i0">When out of the wood that burly fellow</div>
  <div class="i0">Came with his frown, and made a pause</div>
  <div class="i0">In the pulse of their words.&mdash;My lord, Sir Hugh,</div>
  <div class="i0">Stood with the soil on his knee. No cause</div>
  <div class="i0">Had he, but his hanger he partly drew,</div>
  <div class="i0">Then clapped it sharp in its sheath again,</div>
  <div class="i0">And bowed to my lady, and strode away;</div>
  <div class="i0">And vaulting his horse, with a loosened rein</div>
  <div class="i0">Rode with a song in his heart all day.</div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">He loved and was loved, I knew; for, look!</div>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">In the Strongbow forest!&mdash;I know the rock,</div>
  <div class="i0">With its ferns and its moss, by the bramble lair,</div>
  <div class="i0">Where oft and often he met&mdash;by chance,</div>
  <div class="i0">Shall I say?&mdash;the daughter of Clare; as fair</div>
  <div class="i0">Of face as a queen in an old romance,</div>
  <div class="i0">Who waits expectant and pale; her hair</div>
  <div class="i0">Night-deep; and eyes dove-gray with dreams;&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">By the fountain-side where the statue gleams</div>
  <div class="i0">And the moonbeam lolls in the lily white,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">For her knightly lover who comes at night.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Heigh-ho! they ceased, those meetings. I wot,</div>
  <div class="i0">Betrayed to the Baron by some of his crew</div>
  <div class="i0">Of menials who followed and saw and knew.</div>
  <div class="i0">For she loved too well to have once forgot</div>
  <div class="i0">The time and the place of their trysting true.</div>
  <div class="i0">"Why and when?" would ask Sir Hugh</div>
  <div class="i0">In the labored letters he used to lock</div>
  <div class="i0">&mdash;The lovers' post&mdash;in a coigne of that rock.</div>
  <div class="i0">She used to answer, but now did not.</div>
  <div class="i0">But, nearing Yule, love gat them again</div>
  <div class="i0">A twilight tryst&mdash;through frowardness sure!&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">They met. And the day was gray with rain,</div>
  <div class="i0">And snow: and the wind did ever endure</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">A long bleak moaning through the wood,</div>
  <div class="i0">That chapped i' the cheek and smarted the blood;</div>

  <div class="i0">And over it all was the wild-beast sob</div>
  <div class="i0">Of the rushing boughs like a thing pursued.</div>
  <div class="i0">And then it was that he learned how she,</div>
  <div class="i0">(God's blood! how it makes my old limbs quiver</div>
  <div class="i0">To think what a miserable tyrant he&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">The Baron Richard&mdash;aye and ever</div>

  <div class="i0">With an eastern earl&mdash;a Lovell: to whom</div>
  <div class="i0">(Would God o' His mercy had struck him dead!)</div>
  <div class="i0">Clara of Clare when merely a child,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">With a face like a flower, that blows in the wild</div>
  <div class="i0">Of the hills, and a soul like its soft perfume,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Was given&mdash;say, sealed&mdash;to strengthen some ties</div>
  <div class="i0">Of power and wealth&mdash;say bartered, then,</div>
  <div class="i0">Like the veriest chattel. With tearful eyes</div>
  <div class="i0">And lips a-tremble she spoke. And when</div>
  <div class="i0">My lord, her lover, had learned and heard,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">He'd have had her flee with him then, 'sdeath!</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">In spite of them all! Let her say the word,</div>
  <div class="i0">They would fly together: the baron's men</div>
  <div class="i0">Might follow; and if ... and he touched his sword&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0"><em>It</em> should answer! But she, while she seemed to stay,</div>
  <div class="i0">With a hand on her bosom, her heart's quick breath,</div>
  <div class="i0">Replied to his heat: "They would take and slay</div>
  <div class="i0">Thee who art life of my life!&mdash;Not thus</div>
  <div class="i0">Will we fly!&mdash;There's another way for us;</div>
  <div class="i0">A way that is sure; an only way;</div>
  <div class="i0">I have thought on it this many a day."&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">The words that she spake how well I remember!</div>
  <div class="i0">As well as the mood o' that day of December,</div>
  <div class="i0">That bullied and blustered and seemed in league,</div>
  <div class="i0">Like a spiteful shrew, with the wind and the snow,</div>
  <div class="i0">To drown the words of their sweet intrigue,</div>
  <div class="i0">With the boom of the boughs tossed to and fro,</div>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Her last words these, "By curfew sure,</div>

<hr class="tb" />
  <div class="i0">And we were there; with a led horse too;</div>
  <div class="i0">Armed for a journey&mdash;I hardly knew</div>
  <div class="i0">Whither, but why, you well may guess.</div>
  <div class="i0">For often he whispered a certain name,</div>
  <div class="i0">The talisman dear of his happiness,</div>
  <div class="i0">That warmed his blood like a Yule-log's flame.</div>
  <div class="i0">While we waited there, till its owner came,</div>
  <div class="i0">We saw how the castle's baronial girth,</div>
  <div class="i0">Like a giant's, loosed for revelling more,</div>
  <div class="i0">Shone; and we heard the wassail and mirth</div>
  <div class="i0">Where the mistletoe hung in the hearth's red roar,</div>
  <div class="i0">And the holly brightened the weaponed wall</div>
  <div class="i0">Of carven oak in the banqueting hall.</div>
  <div class="i0">And the spits, I trow, by the scullions turned</div>
  <div class="i0">O'er the snoring logs, rich steamed and burned,</div>
  <div class="i0">Where the whole wild-boar and the deer were roasted,</div>
  <div class="i0">And the half of an ox and the roe-buck's haunches;</div>
  <div class="i0">While tuns of ale, that the cellars boasted,</div>
  <div class="i0">And casks of sack, were broached for paunches</div>
  <div class="i0">Of vassals who revelled in stable and hall.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">The song of the minstrel; the yeomen's quarrel</div>

  <div class="i0">In the baying kennels, its hounds a-snarl</div>
  <div class="i0">O'er the bones of the feast; now loud, now low,</div>
  <div class="i0">We could hear where we crouched in the drifting snow.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Was she long? did she come?... By the postern we</div>
  <div class="i0">Like shadows waited. My lord, Sir Hugh,</div>
  <div class="i0">Spoke, pointing a tower: "That casement, see?</div>
  <div class="i0">When a stealthy light in its slit burns blue</div>
  <div class="i0">And signals thrice slowly, thus&mdash;'tis she."</div>
  <div class="i0">And close to his breast his gaberdine drew,</div>
  <div class="i0">For the wind it whipped and the snow beat through.</div>
  <div class="i0">Did she come?&mdash;We had waited an hour or twain,</div>
  <div class="i0">When the taper flashed in the central pane,</div>
  <div class="i0">And flourished three times and vanished so.</div>
  <div class="i0">And under the arch of the postern's portal,</div>
  <div class="i0">Crouched down by the horses we stood in the snow,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Stiff with the cold.&mdash;Ah, me! immortal</div>
  <div class="i0">Minutes we waited, breath-bated, and listened</div>
  <div class="i0">Shivering there in the hurl of the gale:</div>
  <div class="i0">The parapets whistled, the angles glistened,</div>
  <div class="i0">And the night around seemed one black wail</div>
  <div class="i0">Of death, whose ominous presence over</div>
  <div class="i0">The snow-swept battlements seemed to hover.</div>
  <div class="i0">Said my lord, Sir Hugh,&mdash;to himself he spoke,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"She feels for the spring in the sliding panel</div>
  <div class="i0">'Neath the arras, hid in the carven oak.</div>
  <div class="i0">It opens. The stair, like a well's dark channel,</div>
  <div class="i0">Yawns, and the draught makes her taper slope.</div>
  <div class="i0">Wrapped deep in her mantle of fur, she puts</div>
  <div class="i0">One foot on the stair: now a listening pause</div>
  <div class="i0">As nearer and nearer the mad search draws</div>
  <div class="i0">Of the thwarted castle. No smallest hope</div>
  <div class="i0">That they find her now that the panel shuts!</div>
  <div class="i0">If the wind, that howls like a tortured thing,</div>
  <div class="i0">Would throttle itself with its cries, then I</div>
  <div class="i0">Might hear how her hurrying footsteps ring</div>
  <div class="i0">Down the secret ... there! 'tis her fingers try</div>
  <div class="i0">The postern's bolts that the rust makes cling."&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">But 'twas only some whim of the wind that shook</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">A clanging ring on a creaking hook</div>
  <div class="i0">In the buttress or wall. And we waited, numb</div>
  <div class="i0">With the cold, till dawn&mdash;but she did not come.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">I must tell you why and have done: 'Tis said,</div>
  <div class="i0">On the eve of the marriage she fled the side</div>
  <div class="i0">Of the guests and the bridegroom there: she fled</div>
  <div class="i0">With a mischievous laugh,&mdash;"I'll hide! I'll hide!</div>
  <div class="i0">A kiss for the one who shall find!"&mdash;and led</div>
  <div class="i0">A long search after her; but defied</div>
  <div class="i0">All search for&mdash;a score and ten long years.</div>
  <div class="i0">Well, the laughter of Yule was turned to tears</div>
  <div class="i0">For them as for us. We saw the glare</div>
  <div class="i0">Of torches that hurried from chamber to stair;</div>
  <div class="i0">And we heard the castle reëcho her name,</div>
  <div class="i0">But she laughed no answer and never came,</div>
  <div class="i0">And that was the last of Clara of Clare.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">That winter it was, a month thereafter,</div>
  <div class="i0">That the home of the Cliffords, roof and rafter,</div>
  <div class="i0">Burned.&mdash;I could swear 'twas the Strongbow's doing,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Were I sure that he knew of the Clifford's wooing</div>
  <div class="i0">His daughter; and so, by the Rood and Cross!</div>
  <div class="i0">Made a torch of Hugh's home to avenge his loss.&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">So over the Channel to France with his King,</div>
  <div class="i0">The Black Prince, sailed to the wars&mdash;to deaden</div>
  <div class="i0">The ache of the mystery&mdash;Hugh that spring</div>
  <div class="i0">And fell at Poitiers; for his loss lay leaden</div>
  <div class="i0">O' his heart; and his life was a weary sadness,</div>
  <div class="i0">So he flung it away in a moment's madness.</div>
  <div class="i0">And the baron died. And the bridegroom?&mdash;well,</div>
  <div class="i0">Unlucky was he in truth!&mdash;to tell</div>
  <div class="i0">Of him there is nothing.&mdash;The baron died,</div>
  <div class="i0">The last of the Strongbows he&mdash;gramercy!</div>
  <div class="i0">And the Clare estate with its wealth and pride</div>
  <div class="i0">Devolved to the Bloets, Walter and Percy.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">And years went by. And it happened that they</div>
  <div class="i0">Ransacked the old castle; and so, one day,</div>
  <div class="i0">In a lonesome tower uprummaged a chest,</div>
  <div class="i0">From Flanders; of ebon, and wildly carved</div>
  <div class="i0">All over with masks: a sinister crest</div>
  <div class="i0">'Mid gargoyle faces distorted and starved:</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Fast-fixed with a spring, which they forced and, lo!</div>
  <div class="i0">When they opened it&mdash;Death, like a lady dressed,</div>
  <div class="i0">Grinned up at their terror!&mdash;but no, not so!</div>
  <div class="i0">Fantastic a skeleton, jeweled and wreathed</div>
  <div class="i0">With flowers of dust; and a miniver</div>
  <div class="i0">Around it clasped, that the ruin sheathed</div>
  <div class="i0">Of a once rich raiment of silk and of fur.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">I'd have given my life to hear him tell,</div>
  <div class="i0">The courtly Clifford, how this befell!</div>
  <div class="i0">He'd have known how it was: For, you see, in groping</div>
  <div class="i0">For the secret spring of that panel, hoping</div>
  <div class="i0">And fearing as nearer and nearer drew</div>
  <div class="i0">The search of retainers, why, out she blew</div>
  <div class="i0">The tell-tale taper; and seeing this chest,</div>
  <div class="i0">Would hide her a minute in it, mayhap,</div>
  <div class="i0">Till the hurry had passed; but the death-lock, pressed</div>
  <div class="i0">By the lid's great weight, shut down with a snap,</div>
  <div class="i0">And her life went out in the hellish trap.</div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">So the days went by, and the Summer wore</div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">You wearied of the waltz at last.</div>
  <div class="i0">I led you out into the night.</div>
  <div class="i0">Warm in my hand I held yours fast.</div>
  <div class="i0">Your face was flushed; your eyes were bright.</div>
  <div class="i0">The moon hung like a shell of light</div>
  <div class="i0">Above the lake, the tangled trees;</div>
  <div class="i0">And borne to us with fragrances</div>
  <div class="i0">Of roses that were ripe to fall,</div>
  <div class="i0">The soul of music from the hall</div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">I held your arm and, for a while,</div>

  <div class="i0">Fell in a lake,&mdash;deep, woodbine-wound,&mdash;</div>

  <div class="i0">I know not how it was,&mdash;a word,</div>
  <div class="i0">A touch, perhaps, a sigh, a look,</div>
  <div class="i0">Was father to the kiss I took;</div>
  <div class="i0">Great things grow out of small I've heard.</div>
  <div class="i0">And then it was I took between</div>
  <div class="i0">My hands your face, loved Geraldine,</div>

  <div class="i0">The story ever new though old.</div>
  <div class="i0">You did not look away, but met</div>
  <div class="i0">My eyes with eyes whose lids were wet</div>
  <div class="i0">With tears of truth; and you did lean</div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">The night-wind and the water sighed:</div>

  <div class="i0">The melody; the glimmering scene;</div>
  <div class="i0">Your angel face; and ev'n,&mdash;between</div>
  <div class="i0">Your lawny breasts,&mdash;the heart-shaped jewel,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">To which your breath gave fluctuant fuel,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">A rosy star of stormy fire;</div>
  <div class="i0">The snowy drift of your attire,</div>
  <div class="i0">Lace-deep and fragrant: and your hair,</div>

  <div class="i0">By one gemmed pin,&mdash;a moonbeam there,</div>
  <div class="i0">Half-drowned within its night-like black.&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">And I who sat beside you then</div>

  <div class="i0">And the dark Arab, with that last disgrace</div>
  <div class="i0">All fire, answered: "Thou, perhaps, hast heard</div>

  <div class="i8">So, where the Arab stood,</div>
  <div class="i0">Bound him; made kneel upon the cloth of blood.</div>
  <div class="i0">With curving sword the headsman leaned, at pause,</div>
  <div class="i0">And,&mdash;as 'tis custom, made of Moslem laws,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">To the descendant of the Prophet quoth,</div>
  <div class="i0">"O Khalif, shall I strike?"</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i10">"By Iblis' oath!</div>
  <div class="i0">Strike!" answered Hisham. But again the slave</div>
  <div class="i0">Questioned; and yet again the Khalif gave</div>
  <div class="i0">His nodded "yea"; and for the third time then</div>
  <div class="i0">He asked: and knowing neither men nor Jinn</div>
  <div class="i0">Might save him if the Khalif spake assent,</div>
  <div class="i0">Signalled the sword, the youth with body bent</div>
  <div class="i0">Laughed&mdash;till the wang-teeth of each jaw appeared;</div>
  <div class="i0">Laughed&mdash;as with scorn the King of kings he'd beard,</div>
  <div class="i0">Deriding Death. So, with redoubled spleen,</div>
  <div class="i0">Roared Hisham, rising, "It is truly seen</div>
  <div class="i0">This one is mad who mocks at Azrael!"</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Then said the Arab: "Listen!&mdash;Once befell,</div>
  <div class="i0">Commander of the Faithful, that a hawk,</div>
  <div class="i0">A hungry hawk, pounced on a sparrow-cock;</div>
  <div class="i0">And winging nestward with his meal in claw,</div>
  <div class="i0">To him the sparrow,&mdash;for the creature saw</div>
  <div class="i0">The hawk's conceit,&mdash;addressed this slyly, 'Oh,</div>
  <div class="i0">Most great, most royal, there is not, I know,</div>
  <div class="i0">Aught in me that will stay thy stomach's stress:</div>
  <div class="i0">I am too paltry for thy mightiness!'</div>
  <div class="i0">With which the hawk was pleased, and flattered so</div>
  <div class="i0">That, in a while, he let the sparrow go."</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Then smiled the Khalif Hisham: and a sign</div>
  <div class="i0">Staying the scimitar, that hung malign,</div>
  <div class="i0">A threatening crescent, said: "God bless, preserve</div>
  <div class="i0">The Prophet whom all true believers serve!&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Now, by my kinship to the Prophet! and</div>

  <div class="i0">Had ne'er been wrathful; and, instead of hate,</div>
  <div class="i0">He had had all&mdash;except the Khalifate."</div>
  <div class="i0">Bade stuff his mouth with jewels and entreat</div>

  <div class="i0">Rolled out of dusk and dreamy gold</div>
  <div class="i1">One star, whose splendor seemed to light</div>
  <div class="i1">The world with majesty and might.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Like shadows on a shadow-ship</div>
  <div class="i1">The dark-haired, dark-eyed sailors lay;</div>
  <div class="i0">When from the island seemed to slip,</div>
  <div class="i1">Borne overhead and far away,</div>
  <div class="i1">A voice that "Thamus!" seemed to say.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Then silence: and the languid Greek,</div>
  <div class="i1">The lounging Cretan, watched the sky,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Or, in carousal, ceased to speak</div>
  <div class="i1">And sing. Again came rolling by</div>
  <div class="i1">The voice, and "Thamus!" in its cry.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">All were awake: tall, swarthy men</div>
  <div class="i1">With bated breath stood listening,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or gravely scanned the shore. And then,</div>
  <div class="i1">Although they saw no living thing,</div>
  <div class="i1">Again they heard the summons ring.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">And "Thamus!" sounded shore and sea:</div>
  <div class="i1">And at the third call leaned the Greek,</div>
  <div class="i0">Full facing toward the isle; and he</div>
  <div class="i1">Cried to the voice and bade it speak</div>
  <div class="i1">The mission, message it would seek.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"Thou shalt sail on to such a place</div>
  <div class="i1">Among the pagan seas," it said;</div>
  <div class="i0">"To such a land: and thou shalt face</div>
  <div class="i1">Against it when the east is red,</div>
  <div class="i1">And cry aloud, 'Great Pan is dead!'"...</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">As fearful of unholy word</div>
  <div class="i1">Their souls stood stricken with strange fear.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then Thamus said, "Yea, I have heard.</div>

  <div class="i1">Straight on. That land shall never hear!"</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">And so they sailed that night; and came</div>

  <div class="i0">The east burnt like a sword of flame</div>
  <div class="i1">A Cyclops forges: straight the air</div>
  <div class="i1">Fell sick with calm: the morn was fair.</div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Then double dread was theirs; and dread</div>
  <div class="i1">Was Thamus'; and he raised his hand</div>
  <div class="i0">And shouted, "Pan! great Pan is dead!"</div>
  <div class="i1">And all the twilight-haunted land</div>
  <div class="i1">Cried, "Pan is dead!" from peak to strand.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">They saw pale shrines and temples nod</div>
  <div class="i1">Among the shaken trees: and pale</div>
  <div class="i0">Wild forms of goddess and of god</div>
  <div class="i1">Crawl forth with crumbling limbs and trail</div>
  <div class="i1">Woe, till the dim land grew one wail.&mdash;</div>

  <div class="i1">Its monster bulk. Dodona stirred</div>

 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">That left them thunder-riv'n; then passed</div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">To Behram of the Territories, one</div>

  <div class="i0">Her maiden beauty and her warrior strength.</div>
  <div class="i0">Eastward he journeyed from his father's Court,</div>
  <div class="i0">With men and steeds and store of wealth and arms,</div>
  <div class="i0">To the rich city where her father reigned,</div>
  <div class="i0">Its seven citadels set above the sea,</div>
  <div class="i0">Like seven Afrits, threatening all the world;</div>
  <div class="i0">And messengered the monarch with a gift</div>
  <div class="i0">Of savage vessels wroughten out of gold,</div>
  <div class="i0">Of foreign fabrics stiff with gems and gold.</div>
  <div class="i0">Vizier-ambassadored the old king gave</div>
  <div class="i0">His answer to the suitor:&mdash;</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i10">"I, my son,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">What grace have I beyond the grace of God?</div>
  <div class="i0">What power is mine but a material?</div>

 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">And so the lists of war and love arose,</div>
  <div class="i0">Wherein Eddetma with her suitor strove.</div>
  <div class="i0">Mailed in Chorasmian armor, helm and spur,</div>
  <div class="i0">On a great steed she came; Davidean crest</div>
  <div class="i0">And hauberk one fierce blaze of gems. The prince,</div>
  <div class="i0">Harnessed in scaly gold Arabian, rode</div>
  <div class="i0">To meet her; on his arm a mighty shield</div>
  <div class="i0">Of Syrian silver high embossed with gold.</div>
  <div class="i0">So clanged the prologue of the battle. As</div>
  <div class="i0">Closer it waxed, Prince Behram, who a while</div>
  <div class="i0">Withheld his valor,&mdash;in that she he loved</div>
  <div class="i0">Opposed him and beset him, woman whom</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">He had not scathed for the Chosroës' wealth,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Beheld his folly: how he were undone</div>
  <div class="i0">With shining shame unless he strove withal,</div>
  <div class="i0">Whirled fiery sword and smote the bassinet</div>
  <div class="i0">That helmed the haughty face that long had scorned</div>
  <div class="i0">The wide world's vanquished royalty, and so</div>
  <div class="i0">Rushed on his own defeat. For, like unto</div>
  <div class="i0">A cloud, that caverned the bright moon all eve,</div>
  <div class="i0">That thunder splits and, virgin triumph, there</div>
  <div class="i0">She sails a silver aspect, so the helm,</div>
  <div class="i0">Hurled from her head, unhusked her golden hair,</div>
  <div class="i0">And glorious, glowing face. By his own blow</div>
  <div class="i0">Was Behram vanquished. All his wavering strength</div>
  <div class="i0">Swerved from its purpose. With no final stroke</div>
  <div class="i0">Stunned stood he and surrendered: stared and stared,</div>
  <div class="i0">All his strong life absorbed into her face,</div>
  <div class="i0">All the wild warrior arrowed by her eyes,</div>
  <div class="i0">Tamed and obedient to her word and look.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then she on him, as eagle on a kite,</div>
  <div class="i0">Plunged pitiless and beautiful and fierce,</div>
  <div class="i0">One trophy more to added victories:</div>
  <div class="i0">Haled off his mail, amazement dazing him;</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Seized steed and arms, confusion filling him;</div>
  <div class="i0">And scoffed him forth brow-branded with his shame.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Dazzled, six days he sat, a staring trance;</div>
  <div class="i0">But on the seventh, casting stupor off,</div>
  <div class="i0">Rose, and the straitness of the case, that held</div>
  <div class="i0">Him as with manacles of knitted fire,</div>
  <div class="i0">Considered&mdash;and decided on a way....</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Once when Eddetma with an houri band</div>
  <div class="i0">Of high-born damsels, under eunuch guard,</div>
  <div class="i0">In the walled palace pleasaunce took her ease,</div>
  <div class="i0">Under a myrrh-bush by a fountain side,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Where marble Peris poured a diamond rain</div>
  <div class="i0">In scooped cornelian,&mdash;one, a dim, hoar head,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">A patriarch 'mid gardener underlings,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Bent spreading gems and priceless ornaments</div>
  <div class="i0">Of jewelled amulets of hollow gold</div>
  <div class="i0">Sweet with imprisoned ambergris and musk;</div>
  <div class="i0">Symbolic stones in sorcerous carcanets;</div>
  <div class="i0">Gem talismans in cabalistic gold.</div>
  <div class="i0">Whereon the princess marvelled and bade ask&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">What did the ancient with his riches there?</div>
  <div class="i0">Who, questioned, mumbled in his bushy beard,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">"To buy a wife withal;" whereat they laughed</div>
  <div class="i0">As oafs when wisdom stumbles. Quoth a maid,</div>
  <div class="i0">With orient midnight in her starry eyes,</div>
  <div class="i0">And tropic music on her languid tongue,</div>
  <div class="i0">"And what if <em>I</em> should wed with thee, O beard</div>
  <div class="i0">Grayer than my great-grandfather, what then?"&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"One kiss, no more; and, child, thou were divorced,"</div>
  <div class="i0">He; and the humor took them till, like birds</div>
  <div class="i0">That sing among the spice-trees and the palms,</div>
  <div class="i0">The garden pealed with maiden merriment.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Then quoth the princess, "Thou wilt wed with him,</div>
  <div class="i0">Ansada?" mirth in her gazelle-like eyes,</div>
  <div class="i0">And gravity sage-solemn in her speech;</div>
  <div class="i0">And took Ansada's hand and laid it in</div>
  <div class="i0">The old man's staggering hand, and he unbent</div>
  <div class="i0">His crookéd back and on his staff arose</div>
  <div class="i0">Wrinkled and weighed with many heavy years,</div>
  <div class="i0">And kissed her, leaning on his shaking staff,</div>
  <div class="i0">And heaped her bosom with an Amir's wealth,</div>
  <div class="i0">And left them laughing at his foolish beard.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Now on the next day, as she took her ease</div>
  <div class="i0">With her glad troop of girlhood,&mdash;maidens who</div>
  <div class="i0">So many royal tulips seemed,&mdash;behold,</div>
  <div class="i0">Bowed with white years, upon a flowery sward</div>
  <div class="i0">The ancient with new jewelry and gems</div>
  <div class="i0">Wherefrom the sun coaxed wizard fires and lit</div>
  <div class="i0">Glimmers in glowing green and pendent pearl,</div>
  <div class="i0">Ultramarine and beaded, vivid rose.</div>
  <div class="i0">And so they stood and wondered; and one asked,</div>
  <div class="i0">As yesternoon, wherefore the father there</div>
  <div class="i0">Displayed his Sheikh locks and the genie gems.&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"Another marriage and another kiss?&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">What! doth the tomb-ripe court his youth again?</div>
  <div class="i0">O aged one, libertine in hope not deed!</div>
  <div class="i0">O prodigal of wives as well as wealth!</div>
  <div class="i0">Here stands thy damsel," trilled the Peri-tall</div>
  <div class="i0">Diarra with the midnight in her hair,</div>
  <div class="i0">Two lemon-blossoms blowing in her cheeks;</div>
  <div class="i0">And took the dotard's jewels with the kiss</div>
  <div class="i0">In merry mockery.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i7">Ere the morrow's dawn</div>
  <div class="i0">Bethought Eddetma: "Shall my handmaidens,</div>
  <div class="i0">Humoring a gray-beard's whim, for wrinkled smiles</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">And withered kisses still divide his wealth?</div>
  <div class="i0">While I stand idle, lose the caravan</div>
  <div class="i0">Whose least is notable?&mdash;I too will wed,</div>
  <div class="i0">Betide me what betides."</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i9">And with the morn</div>
  <div class="i0">Before the man,&mdash;for privily she came,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Stood habited, as were her tire-maids,</div>
  <div class="i0">In humbler raiment. Now the ancient saw</div>
  <div class="i0">And knew her for the princess that she was,</div>
  <div class="i0">And kindling gladness of the knowledge made</div>
  <div class="i0">Two sparkling forges of his deep-set eyes</div>
  <div class="i0">Beneath the ashes of his priestly brows.</div>
  <div class="i0">Not timidly she came; but coy approach</div>
  <div class="i0">Became a maiden of Eddetma's suite.</div>
  <div class="i0">She, gazing on the jewels he had spread</div>
  <div class="i0">Beneath the rose-bower by the fountain, said:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"The princess gave me leave, O grandfather.</div>
  <div class="i0">Here is my hand in marriage, here my lips.</div>
  <div class="i0">Adorn thy bride; then grant me my divorce."</div>
  <div class="i0">And humbly answered he, "With all my heart!"&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Responsive to her quavering request,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"The daughter of the king did give thee leave?</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">And thou wouldst wed?&mdash;Then let us not delay.&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Thy hand! thy lips!" So he arose and heaped</div>
  <div class="i0">Her with barbaric jewelry and gems,</div>
  <div class="i0">And took her hand and from her lips the kiss.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then from his age, behold, the dotage fell,</div>
  <div class="i0">And from the man all palsied hoariness.</div>
  <div class="i0">Victorious-eyed and amorous, a youth,</div>
  <div class="i0">A god in ardent capabilities,</div>
  <div class="i0">Resistless held her; and she, swooning, saw,</div>
  <div class="i0">Transfigured and triumphant bending o'er,</div>
  <div class="i0">Gloating, the branded brow of Prince Behram.</div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
